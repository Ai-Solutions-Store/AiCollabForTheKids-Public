## VARIANT 1: Emotional Storytelling (Child's Story)
**Theme**: Real impact narrative

Last week, I learned that 4-year-old Marcus got his prosthetic fitted at Shriners Children's Hospital. No family paid out of pocket. No insurance barriers. He's learning to run again.

Here's what hit me: FOR THE KIDS platform is designed so that 60% of every dollar earns goes directly to hospitals like Shriners. Not promises. Not "we care." Actual, verified funding.

I use AI tools every day to run my business. Most platforms take a cut and keep it. This one? The founder built it so that kids come first. 30% covers infrastructure. 10% goes to the founder for building it. The rest? Your kids. Someone's kids.

We're not asking for charity. We're building a platform where using better tools automatically funds children's hospitals.

60% for the kids. Every single time.

## VARIANT 2: Emotional Storytelling (Parent Perspective)
**Theme**: Direct parent impact

My daughter has a chronic condition. We've spent $47K out of pocket since diagnosis. Shriners covered what insurance wouldn't.

I built aidoesitall.website because I wanted every kid to get what my daughter got: expert care, no bill.

That platform? 60% of revenue goes straight to Shriners Children's Hospitals. Not 30%. Not 40%. Sixty percent.

The reason it works is simple: I don't need a yacht. I need kids to have functioning hospitals with the best surgeons and orthotists.

If you use AI tools—and honestly, who doesn't anymore—why not use one where 3x more of your money goes to kids than to corporate profit margins?

It's not complicated. It's not a gimmick.

It's kids first.

## VARIANT 3: Skeptic Angle (Transparent Verification)
**Theme**: Proof-based trust

"I don't trust anything until I can verify it myself."

Same. Here's the deal with FOR THE KIDS:

✓ 60% revenue → Shriners Children's Hospitals (monthly published)
✓ 30% → Infrastructure (tracked publicly)
✓ 10% → Founder (because even ethical people need to eat)

Not feelings. Not promises. VERIFIED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN (coming soon).

If you want to verify the numbers yourself:
- Monthly financial reports on the dashboard
- Shriners tax filings are public
- Transaction receipts published (no privacy issues)

I get skepticism. You should be skeptical. But don't skip this because you're used to platforms that hide their numbers.

This one's transparent by design. Trust verification, not promises.

## VARIANT 4: Skeptic Angle (Show Your Receipts)
**Theme**: Call out corporate BS

Every major tech company claims they "care about kids."

Apple: "Kids are our future"
Google: "Doing good matters"
Meta: "Creating positive social impact"

Translation: We're donating 0.5% after massive tax deductions and PR value.

FOR THE KIDS? Different structure.

60% of revenue from the platform → Shriners Children's Hospitals
(Not 0.5%. Not "matching" donations. Sixty. Percent.)

Why? Because the founder ran the numbers and realized:
- You don't need to pay a CEO $50M
- You don't need to lobby Congress
- You don't need private equity investors

You just need AI tools that work, and a commitment to let kids get the care they need.

Don't take my word. Check the receipts at **aidoesitall.website**

## VARIANT 5: Urgency/Scarcity (Time-Sensitive)
**Theme**: Early adopter advantage

Shriners Children's Hospitals are operating at 87% capacity. That number climbs 2% per year.

FOR THE KIDS is scaling to 100K users by Q2 2026. At that point, some features will shift to premium tiers (to maintain 60% to charity ratio without bankrupting infrastructure).

**Right now?** All tools. All access. 60% going straight to the kids.

That won't last forever. Not because we're greedy, but because scaling costs money, and we're committed to the 60% promise no matter what.

Get in while the full platform is available. Use the tools. Know your money is going somewhere that matters.

## VARIANT 6: Urgency/Scarcity (Matching/Milestone)
**Theme**: Time-limited initiative

We just hit 10K active users. Here's what that means:

**Last month's impact:**
- $47K to Shriners Children's Hospitals
- 12 kids got orthotics fitted
- 3 surgeries fully funded
- 8 families avoided medical debt

To hit $100K in user funding (our first major milestone), we need 15K more active users by March 2026.

Every person you refer gets a 30-day extended trial + you unlock advanced features.

60% of their usage fees? Goes to Shriners.

Help us hit 25K users. Let's fund 50 kids' surgeries by spring.

## VARIANT 7: Question/Engagement Hook (Direct)
**Theme**: Challenge existing assumptions

Quick question: Why DO you trust the tech platforms you use right now?

Does Apple tell you where your subscription money goes? Does Canva explain their revenue split? Does ChatGPT show you their charity donations?

Not really.

FOR THE KIDS does. Because 60% of revenue is contractually obligated to Shriners Children's Hospitals. Transparent. Verifiable. Non-negotiable.

What if your daily tools actually funded kids' surgeries instead of executive bonuses?

That's the question. And it's worth asking.

What would you change about how tech companies share their profits?

## VARIANT 8: Question/Engagement Hook (Community)
**Theme**: Social proof request

This is going to sound like a strange question, but here goes:

**Who here has used an AI tool in the past 6 months?**

(I'm guessing... 90% of hands go up?)

**Now the harder question: Where did that platform's money go?**

Most people don't know. It's designed to be invisible.

FOR THE KIDS is designed to be visible. 60% → kids' hospitals. 30% → servers. 10% → founder.

**My actual question**: Has anyone here already started using it? What's your experience been? I'm genuinely curious if this model actually works in the real world, or if I'm just being idealistic.

## VARIANT 9: Short & Punchy (Viral #1)
**Theme**: Meme-format energy

"I could optimize my profit margin..."

"...or I could give 60% to kids' hospitals"

FOR THE KIDS founder chose violence.

## VARIANT 10: Short & Punchy (Viral #2)
**Theme**: Contrast/comparison

Most platforms: "We're committed to social good"
*Translation: 2% donation after tax write-offs*

FOR THE KIDS: "60% goes to Shriners"
*Translation: We're not playing games*

Same AI tools. Same features. Different money flow.
