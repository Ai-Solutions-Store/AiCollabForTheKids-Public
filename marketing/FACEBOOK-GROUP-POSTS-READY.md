## POST 1: PARENT GROUPS (Mom groups, parenting groups)

**Copy this:**

```
My kid asked me why some kids can't afford to go to the hospital.

I didn't have a good answer. So I built something.

60% of everything made goes directly to Shriners Children's Hospitals. Not "some proceeds." Not "a portion." Sixty percent. Every time.

It's an AI platform - helps with work, productivity, the stuff we all need. But the money goes to kids who need it more.

No catch. No MLM. Just a dad who wanted to do something real.

## POST 2: ENTREPRENEUR/STARTUP GROUPS

**Copy this:**

```
Built an AI platform with a weird business model:

60% → Children's hospitals
30% → Infrastructure
10% → Me

Most founders would call me crazy. But here's the thing - it's locked in code. I literally can't change it even if I wanted to.

The AI tools work. The charity split is automatic. Every transaction = kids get helped.

Looking for early users who want AI tools AND want their money to actually do something good.

## POST 3: NONPROFIT/CHARITY GROUPS

**Copy this:**

```
What if every business gave 60% to charity?

I built one that does.

FOR THE KIDS is an AI platform where 60% of all revenue goes to verified pediatric charities (Shriners Children's Hospitals).

Not a nonprofit. A for-profit that hardcoded generosity into its DNA.

Every AI tool purchased = direct allocation to kids.

Blockchain-verified. Transparent. Immutable.

## POST 4: SIDE HUSTLE/INCOME GROUPS

**Copy this:**

```
Found an AI platform that does something different.

You use it for work/productivity (legit AI tools).
60% of what you pay goes to children's hospitals.
Not a scam. Not an MLM. Just a different business model.

Use AI. Help kids. That simple.

Starter tier is $10. That's $6 to Shriners Children's Hospitals, automatically.

## POST 5: GENERAL/VIRAL ATTEMPT

**Copy this:**

```
An AI told its founder to take a pay cut.

He wanted 20% of revenue. The AI said "Give it to the kids."

Now it's locked in code:
- 60% to children's hospitals
- 30% to keep the platform running
- 10% to the founder

The AI had better ethics than most CEOs.

This is real. The platform is live. Every dollar spent = 60 cents to kids.
