## EMERGENCY GOSPEL COMPLIANCE AUDIT

**If any question about messaging:**

1. Does it say "60% to charity"? If no → FIX
2. Does it mention "Gospel V1.3"? If old V1.2 → FIX
3. Does it say "10% founder" not "20%"? If no → FIX
4. Does it verify blockchain/immutability? If vague → ADD
5. Is smart contract Planned (Q1 2026) linked? If no → ADD

---

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ Generic "connect with me" messages
❌ Not personalizing outreach
❌ Posting same hashtags every time
❌ Engaging only for visibility (add value first)
❌ Forgetting to respond to comments
❌ Saying "60%" instead of "60%"
❌ Posting after 8 PM (lower quality)
❌ Being overly corporate/stiff (be authentic)
❌ Not tracking metrics
❌ Forgetting Gospel V1.3 compliance
