# BOOK & AUTHOR MARKETING STRATEGY FOR THE KIDS

**Campaign:** https://aidoesitall.website
**Mission:** 60% of all revenue to Verified Pediatric Charities (Gospel V1.3 compliant)
**Created:** December 16, 2025
**Status:** READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Authors have trusted followings of readers who care about stories, values, and impact. FOR THE KIDS positions itself as the platform where children's book authors, self-published creators, and literary influencers can sell their work while directly supporting verified pediatric charities.

**Revenue Model:**
- 60% → Verified Pediatric Charities

#### Phase 1: Bookstore Partnership Development

**Email to Barnes & Noble Community Relations:**

```
Subject: FOR THE KIDS + Barnes & Noble Author Event Partnership

Dear [Community Relations Manager],

I'm reaching out because Barnes & Noble has something special: a community that believes books matter.

FOR THE KIDS is a platform where book signings become community fundraisers. Here's how:

TRADITIONAL BOOK SIGNING:
- Author signs books
- Store sells books
- Author goes home
- Community feeling is "I bought a book"

FOR THE KIDS BOOK SIGNING:
- Author signs books
- Store sells books via FOR THE KIDS
- Real-time display: "$1,200 generated for [Hospital Name]"
- Author + bookstore + customers celebrate impact together
- Community feeling is "I supported kids in hospitals"

WHY B&N Should Care:
✓ Differentiation (B&N becomes "purpose-driven" bookseller)
✓ Community engagement (events become fundraisers)
✓ Foot traffic (people come for cause + books)
✓ PR (local news covers book signing + charity angle)
✓ Customer loyalty (customers feel they matter)

WHAT WE PROVIDE:
- Marketing (pre-event promotion to FOR THE KIDS community)
- Materials (signage, impact tracking display)
- Author coordination (we coordinate author + timing)
- Real-time impact tracker (shows contributions during event)
- Social media content (photos + story for both organizations)

WHAT B&N DOES:
- Host event (normal book signing)
- Sell FOR THE KIDS copies (via our platform)
- Promote to community (normal marketing)

B&N keeps normal book revenue.
60% of FOR THE KIDS purchases go to charity.

Ready to pilot this?

## SECTION 9: E-BOOK CHARITY ROYALTY PROGRAM

### Market Opportunity: $1.3B Digital Publishing Market

**Why E-Books?**

1. **Higher Margins:** No printing costs (60% to charity is viable)
2. **Global Reach:** Instant delivery, no geography barriers
3. **Scalable:** Authors can publish once, sell forever
4. **Data Rich:** Track reader behavior, engagement, geography
5. **Low Friction:** One-click purchase (high conversion)

### E-Book Platform Integration Strategy

#### Approach 1: Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing Integration

**Challenge:** Amazon doesn't allow third-party revenue sharing

**Solution:** White-label e-book distribution (manage independently)

**Model:**
- Authors upload manuscript to FOR THE KIDS e-book platform
- FOR THE KIDS distributes to Kindle, Apple Books, Google Play, etc.
- Revenue tracked + split: 60% charity, 30% platform, 10% author
- Authors set retail price (FOR THE KIDS takes distributor fee)

**Technical Setup:**
- Author uploads manuscript (Word doc + cover)
- FOR THE KIDS converts to multiple formats (ePub, Mobi, PDF)
- Quality check (formatting, covers, metadata)
- Upload to: Kindle, Apple Books, Google Play, Scribd
- Real-time royalty tracking dashboard
- Monthly payouts to authors

**Author Revenue Model:**

```
Retail Price: $9.99

FOR THE KIDS Takes:
- Distributor fee (15% = $1.50)
- Platform fee (5% = $0.50)

Remaining: $7.99

Split:
- Charity: 60% = $4.79
- Author: 40% = $3.20

Author ends up with: $3.20 per sale
(Compare: KDP gives authors 35% = $3.50, but no impact option)
```

**Why Authors Accept This:**
- Impact mission (Gospel V1.3)
- FOR THE KIDS marketing (bigger audience)
- Community (author network)
- Featured placement (higher visibility = more sales)

#### Approach 2: Self-Hosted E-Book Distribution

**Sell directly from FOR THE KIDS website:**

**Platform:**
- Gumroad (easiest): Authors send manuscript → Gumroad link → FOR THE KIDS embeds
- Stripe: FOR THE KIDS payment processing → author gets royalties
- Custom solution: FOR THE KIDS builds proprietary system

**Gumroad Model:**
- Authors upload to Gumroad
- FOR THE KIDS links to their product
- Gumroad takes 10% fee
- Revenue split: 60% charity, 30% platform, 10% author
- Transparent tracking for authors

**Advantage:** 100% author control + FOR THE KIDS ecosystem visibility

**Goal:** 50+ e-books in first 6 months, 500+ by end of year

#### Approach 3: Serialized E-Book / Subscription Model

**Concept:** Chapter-by-chapter e-books with subscription revenue share

**How It Works:**
1. Author writes book (or submits completed manuscript)
2. FOR THE KIDS publishes as series (one chapter per week)
3. Readers subscribe ($4.99/month) to get weekly chapters
4. Revenue split: 60% charity, 30% platform, 10% author
5. After serialization complete: Full e-book available

**Example:**
```
Week 1: Chapter 1 released (subscribers get exclusive access)
Week 2: Chapter 2 released
Week 3: Chapter 3 released
...
Week 12: Chapter 12 released
Week 13: Full compiled e-book available for one-time purchase

Subscriber Revenue:
- 12 weeks x $4.99 = ~$60 per subscriber per book
- 1,000 subscribers x $60 = $60,000 revenue per book
- Author gets: $6,000
- Charity gets: $36,000
```

**Why This Works:**
- Authors get recurring revenue (predictable)
- Readers feel like they're part of story (community)
- Charity gets predictable funding stream
- FOR THE KIDS gets subscriber base (recurring revenue!)

**Platform:** Substack, Ghost, or custom

### E-Book Marketing Strategy

**Subscribers:** Target 50K+ within 12 months

   - $30 to [Hospital Name]

   ```

2. **"Chapter Reactions"**
   ```

   Records emotional reaction/review
   "This book is heartbreaking and I love it.
   Every purchase supports kids in hospitals.

   ```

3. **"Author Q&A"**
   ```
   Creator interviews e-book author
   "Why did you self-publish on FOR THE KIDS?"
   "What does Gospel V1.3 mean to you as an author?"
   Exclusive book excerpt
   ```

#### Marketing Channel 4: Author Cross-Promotion

**E-Book Author Support:**

1. **Affiliate Program for Authors**
   - Authors can promote other authors' e-books
   - 5% commission on referred sales
   - Share affiliate link on social media

2. **Author Promotional Calendar**

#### Author Central Content Strategy

**Post Ideas (Monthly):**

1. "Why I Joined FOR THE KIDS" (Gospel V1.3 explanation)
2. "How Your Book Purchase Supports Kids' Hospitals" (Impact transparency)
3. "Behind the Scenes: Writing [Book Title]" (Engagement)
4. "Gospel V1.3: A New Way to Impact" (Mission explainer)
5. "Reader Stories: How My Books Changed Lives" (Community)
6. "My Next Project: Continuing the Impact Mission" (Future roadmap)

**Sample Blog Post:**

```
WHY I JOINED FOR THE KIDS (And Why You Should Care)

When my agent asked me why I wanted to switch to FOR THE KIDS, I had a simple answer:

I write books about hope. But I wanted to DO hope, not just write about it.

FOR THE KIDS is a platform where readers and authors work together to support kids in hospitals. It's Gospel V1.3—a commitment that 60% of every book sale goes directly to verified pediatric charities.

When you buy my books on FOR THE KIDS, here's what happens:

- 60% goes to kids' hospitals (real medical care)
- 30% keeps the platform running
- 10% goes to Joshua Coleman, the founder

Transparent. Verified. Impactful.

I've sold books on Amazon for years. Traditional publishing served me well. But I wanted something more—a way for readers to know their purchase actually helped kids fighting serious illnesses.

FOR THE KIDS is that way.

Every book you buy supports:
- [Hospital A] - pediatric research
- [Hospital B] - family support programs
- [Hospital C] - specialized care

Not as charity. As a purchase. As real revenue.

Gospel V1.3 makes that possible.

Subject: FOR THE KIDS + Barnes & Noble: A Values Partnership Opportunity

Dear [VP Name],

I'm reaching out because Barnes & Noble is uniquely positioned to transform the book industry.

FOR THE KIDS is a movement where authors, readers, and retailers work together to support kids in hospitals. Every book sold sends 60% of proceeds to verified pediatric charities.

We'd like to partner with B&N to:

1. Create dedicated "FOR THE KIDS" section in 600 stores
2. Integrate mission-driven books into B&N's values messaging
3. Co-brand author events (physical + virtual)
4. Give B&N customers a meaningful way to "vote with their dollars"

Why B&N?
- You're a trusted authority in books (customers listen to you)
- Your author event infrastructure is unmatched
- Your community is values-driven
- This differentiates B&N from Amazon

Why Now?
- 60% of readers want to support causes while they shop
- Publishers are looking for distribution partners with mission alignment
- COVID reminded us what matters (kids, health, hope)
- Gospel V1.3 offers transparent, blockchain-verified impact

I'd love 20 minutes to discuss this opportunity.
