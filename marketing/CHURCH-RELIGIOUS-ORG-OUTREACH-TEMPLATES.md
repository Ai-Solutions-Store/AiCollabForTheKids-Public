Skip ONE gift you'd normally give yourself this year. contribute that amount to FOR THE KIDS instead.

**Why Now?**
- 15M+ American children face health challenges
- Families can't afford treatment
- Pediatric charities rely on year-end giving
- Your gift reaches kids immediately

**The Impact of Holiday Gifts to FOR THE KIDS:**
- $50 = One child's mental health session

### Announcement B: Medium (Half-Page Bulletin)

**Word Count: 200**

**God's Work, Our Hands: Introducing FOR THE KIDS**

Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me." That mandate guides how we respond to suffering.

FOR THE KIDS is a movement ensuring that children facing health challenges receive care, support, and hope. Here's what makes it different:

**60% of ALL revenue goes directly to children's hospitals.** Not eventually. Not after expenses. Structurally guaranteed.

This applies to pediatric cancer treatment, mental health services, emergency care for uninsured children, and education programs.

**Three Ways to Help:**
1. **contribute** online at https://aidoesitall.website
2. **Volunteer** at our community fundraiser [date]
3. **Share** with family and friends

Your support saves lives.

### Announcement C: Full-Page Bulletin Feature

**Word Count: 500**

**FOR THE KIDS: A New Way to Live Our Faith**

"Truly I tell you, whatever you did for the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me." - Matthew 25:31-46

In our faith, we're called to care for vulnerable children. Yet every day, 15 million American children face serious health challenges their families can't afford to treat.

**What If Business Could Be Redemptive?**

FOR THE KIDS asks a radical question: What if a business existed solely to support sick children?

The answer: 60% of every dollar reaches verified pediatric charities.

**That's Different Because:**
- Transparent: You can audit the numbers
- Structural: It's built into the business, not optional
- Immediate: Money reaches hospitals NOW, not "after overhead"
- Diverse: Supports all children, all faiths, all backgrounds

**Why This Matters to Our Congregation:**

[Insert faith-specific angle]:
- **Christian:** Jesus healed the sick and blessed children. This business does both.
- **Jewish:** Tikkun Olam (repairing the world) means embedding justice into systems. FOR THE KIDS does that.
- **Islamic:** Sadaqah Jariyah (continuous giving) creates ongoing healing. This model is built on continuous support.
- **Buddhist:** Karuna (compassion) means active response to suffering. Every transaction heals.
- **Hindu/Sikh:** Seva (selfless service) is highest calling. This business embodies it.

**Three Concrete Ways to Engage:**

1. **Give a One-Time Gift**
   Visit https://aidoesitall.website
   contribute any amount (even $5 matters)
   Receive tax deduction + impact report

2. **Host a Fundraiser**
   Our team handles everything
   You provide space + community
   Average result: $2,000-$5,000 raised
   Contact: [email]

3. **Become a Monthly Sustainer**
   $5-$500/month (your choice)
   Automatic giving (you set and forget)
   Ongoing support for ongoing need
   Start here: https://aidoesitall.website/monthly

**Youth Group Challenge:**
Can your group raise $500 this spring? We'll help you organize fundraisers and track impact.

Contact: [youth coordinator]

**A Final Word:**

Children don't choose poverty. They don't choose illness. They don't choose whether their family can afford treatment.

FOR THE KIDS says: "We choose for them. We choose healing."

Will you join us?

## SECTION 3: FAITH LEADER LETTER TEMPLATES

### Template A: Denominational Leader Letter (Mainline Protestant)

**[DENOMINATION LETTERHEAD]**

**To the Pastors and Leaders of [Denomination]:**

Greetings in Christ,

I write to you about an opportunity that embodies our [denomination's] core commitment: **serving vulnerable children through justice.**

FOR THE KIDS is a campaign that structures children's healthcare support into business itself. 60% of revenue goes directly to verified pediatric charities. Not as charity. As justice—embedded in how business operates.

In our theological tradition, we understand that personal piety isn't enough. We're called to **systemic change**. FOR THE KIDS models what that looks like: a business built on the principle that profit and compassion can be one.

**I'm Inviting Your Congregation To:**

1. **Learn about FOR THE KIDS** through our information packet (attached)
2. **Host a conversation** with your adult education committee
3. **Participate in our spring fundraiser** (date TBD)
4. **Endorse our mission** as faith leaders (no financial obligation)

**Why I'm Behind This:**

I've examined FOR THE KIDS' financial model, charity partnerships, and operational transparency. This isn't marketing. It's structural justice.

Our children need us. Our institutions need reformation. This campaign offers both.

**Next Steps:**

Leaders interested in more information should contact [name] at [email].

In faith and service,

### Template B: Catholic Leadership Letter

**[DIOCESE/PARISH LETTERHEAD]**

**Vatican II and FOR THE KIDS: Living the Gospel**

Dear Brother Priests and Parish Leaders,

In Vatican II, the Church reaffirmed our mission: to bring Christ's healing to a wounded world.

Catholic Social Teaching emphasizes:
- **Human Dignity:** Every child is made in God's image
- **Solidarity:** We're responsible for vulnerable others
- **Subsidiarity:** Communities solve problems at local level
- **The Common Good:** Justice demands structural change

**FOR THE KIDS embodies all four.**

A new campaign is inviting Catholic communities to support America's children through verified pediatric charities. Here's what's revolutionary: 60% of business revenue goes directly to care. That's Gospel in economics.

**As Your Bishop/Pastoral Leader, I Recommend:**

1. Explore partnership possibilities with FOR THE KIDS
2. Share information with parish councils
3. Consider hosting a fundraiser
4. Pray about how your parish can engage

**Practical Next Steps:**

Interested parishes should contact [name] at [email] to receive:
- Information packet
- Sample bulletin announcements
- Fundraiser toolkit
- Training for parish leadership

**Our Children Are Waiting:**

15 million American children face health crises their families can't afford. These are our children. Our responsibility. Our moment to act.

FOR THE KIDS offers a concrete way to say: "We're with you. The Church shows up."

In Christ's love,

### Template C: Jewish Leadership Letter

**[SYNAGOGUE/ORGANIZATION LETTERHEAD]**

**Tikkun Olam: Repairing the World With FOR THE KIDS**

Dear Rabbis, Cantors, and Community Leaders,

Judaism teaches us: "Tikkun Olam"—repairing the world—is not optional. It's obligation.

For millennia, we've asked: "How do we embed justice into our systems?"

FOR THE KIDS answers: **By making business itself just.**

This campaign guarantees 60% of revenue supports pediatric charities. Not hope. Not aspiration. Structural commitment.

In our tradition, we recognize:
- **Tzedakah** is righteous obligation, not charity
- **Pikuach Nefesh** (saving a life) overrides all other commandments
- **Tikkun Olam** means systemic change

FOR THE KIDS models all three.

**I'm Inviting Your Community To:**

1. **Learn more** through our information materials
2. **Host a conversation** (we provide curriculum)
3. **Participate in fundraising** (4 hours, high impact)
4. **Endorse our mission** as Jewish leaders

**Why This Matters Now:**

Our children are sick. Our healthcare system is broken. Business-as-usual won't fix it.

Tikkun Olam means we don't ask permission. We don't wait. We rebuild.

FOR THE KIDS is rebuilding. We invite you to build with us.

**Next Steps:**

Contact [name] at [email] to receive:
- Comprehensive program materials
- Jewish theological framework document
- Fundraiser templates
- Community education resources

### Template D: Islamic Leadership Letter (Imam/Imam Council)

**[MOSQUE/ORGANIZATION LETTERHEAD]**

**Sadaqah Jariyah: Continuous Giving For Children's Healing**

As-salamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh,

In the name of Allah, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful.

Allah teaches us: "The best charity is Sadaqah Jariyah—continuous giving that benefits others long after the giver passes."

FOR THE KIDS has organized business itself around this principle. 60% of all revenue flows continuously to verified pediatric charities supporting America's children.

In our tradition, we understand:
- **Zakat** is structural giving (2.5% of wealth)
- **Sadaqah** is voluntary compassion
- **Amanah** (trustworthiness) means transparent, reliable action

FOR THE KIDS embodies all three.

**I Invite Our Ummah To:**

1. **Learn about FOR THE KIDS** (materials in Arabic available)
2. **Host community conversations** about ethical business
3. **Participate in fundraising** supporting pediatric charities
4. **Endorse our mission** as Muslim leaders

**Why This Matters:**

Children in American hospitals—Muslim and non-Muslim—need care. Our Islamic values call us to action, not just prayer.

FOR THE KIDS makes action possible.

**The Path Forward:**

Mosques and leaders interested in partnership should contact [name] at [email].

We're providing:
- Materials in English and Arabic
- Islamic ethical framework document
- Community education curriculum
- Fundraising toolkits

*Ma sha Allah, Alhamdulillah.* Through God's will, by God's grace.
