canonical_url: https://yourplatform.com/article
---
```

```

### Medium Customization

```
HEADLINE: Why Blockchain Changes Charity: A 60% Solution for Impact

This week, we proved something controversial:
Blockchain verification works better than traditional charity oversight.

Here's why it matters for business and impact:

1. TRANSPARENCY ATTRACTS CAPITAL
   Companies that prove 60% goes to kids get more investors,
   not fewer. Seems counterintuitive. Actually makes sense.

2. SMART CONTRACTS PREVENT MISSION DRIFT
   Five years in, founder gets tempted to take more.
   Code prevents it. Psychology + enforcement.

3. VERIFICATION BUILDS LOYALTY
   supporters don't need faith. They need proof.
   Blockchain = proof. Loyalty follows.

Real example:
Our first 5,000 subscribers didn't hesitate.
When they could verify the split on blockchain,
conversion rate jumped 42%.

The takeaway: Transparency isn't just ethical.
It's better business.

- Week 2: Substack exclusive deep-dive

- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- Use emojis sparingly (1-2 per email)
- Include "Forward to a friend" link

Hi [Name],

I just published a series on the FOR THE KIDS model:
1. Building Transparent Charity Tech [link]
2. Gospel V1.3 Revenue Architecture [link]
3. AI contribution Matching [link]
4. Base Blockchain Tutorial [link]
5. How We Built aidoesitall.website [link]

These explain exactly how we're proving that 60% to charity
is better business than typical founder economics.

If you care about this kind of work, you'll probably find
at least one essay interesting.

I'd love your feedback.

— Joshua

## CRISIS & NEGATIVE COMMENT HANDLING

### How to Respond to Skepticism

**Common skeptic question:** "How do I know you actually give 60% to charity?"

**Best response:**
```
Great question - exactly what skeptics should ask.

Here's the proof:
1. Smart contract is open-source on GitHub
2. Contract is audited (link to audit)
3. Every transaction logged on Base Mainnet
4. View here: [BaseScan link]
5. Charity wallets verified through traditional 990 filings

You don't need to trust us. You can verify it yourself.
That's the whole point.

Still skeptical? Happy to walk through the code with you.
```

**Common skeptic question:** "This is too good to be true. Where's the catch?"

**Best response:**
```
The catch is: I make less money than I could.

A traditional founder would take 70-90% of revenue.
I take 10%.

For most investors, that's insane.
For me, it's the entire point.

I'm genuinely betting that:
1. People want to support this model
2. I can build something valuable AND help kids
3. Growth comes from mission alignment, not founder profit

Could I be wrong? Absolutely.
But I'd rather fail trying this than succeed by doing what everyone else does.

If that seems suspicious, I understand. But there's no hidden trick.
Just a founder choosing to help kids instead of get rich.
```

**Common skeptic question:** "Won't this model fail at scale?"

**Best response:**
```
Maybe. Here's my thinking on why it won't:

As revenue grows:
- $10k ? $6k to charity, $3k infra, $1k founder
- $100k ? $60k to charity, $30k infra, $10k founder
- $1M ? $600k to charity, $300k infra, $100k founder

At $1M scale, $100k is solid founder income + hiring team.
At $10M scale, $1M founder income is very healthy.

The model doesn't break. It scales healthily.

What might break: Investor appetite for VC returns.
But we're not taking VC money that demands 10x returns.

We're taking customer money that wants impact.
Different constraints, different model.
```
