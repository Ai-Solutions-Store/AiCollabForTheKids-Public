## CONTENT SNIPPETS (Copy-Paste Ready)

### 60/30/10 Explanation (Short)
```
Here's how the 60/30/10 split works:
? 60% - Verified Pediatric Charities (goal: help thousands of children)
? 30% - Infrastructure & Growth (keeps platform running 24/7)
? 10% - Founder (sustainable development)

This isn't a promise. It's code. Hardcoded in planned smart contract (backend enforcement active).
```

### Gospel V1.3 Upgrade Mention
```
From day one, FOR THE KIDS was built on Gospel V1.3
(60/30/10). The founder took LESS so kids could get MORE. This is permanent.
```

### Smart Contract Link
```
Verify on blockchain: https://basescan.org/address/Planned (Q1 2026)
```

### Referral Link Mention
```
Share your referral link: https://aidoesitall.website/ref/{{referralCode}}
When your friend goes Pro: You both get 1 month free
```

### Impact Calculation
```
Your subscription: $49/month
Profit margin: ~70% = $34.30
Allocated to kids: 60% = $20.58/month
Children helped: 1 per 8 years
```

## TONE & VOICE GUIDELINES

### ? DO:
- Be transparent about 60% to kids (it's our differentiator)
- Use technical language (we're Vercel/Datadog positioning, not charity)
- Show data and proofs (blockchain, transaction hashes, child counts)
- Be direct and honest (no hype, no tricks)
- Reference Joshua Coleman's personal story (human element)
- Use "FOR THE KIDS" with conviction

### ? DON'T:
- Use emotional manipulation or guilt tactics
- Make vague claims ("help children" without numbers)
- Hide the 60% allocation (it's our strongest feature)
- Sound like a typical nonprofit (we're a for-profit with a mission)
- Use passive language ("we help" ? "60% of your profit goes to kids")
- Apologize for the business model (it's ethical and proven)

### EXAMPLE TONE:
```
"You're not just buying a tool. Your $49 subscription allocates $20.58 to
Verified Pediatric Charities. That's 1 child helped every 8 years. Multiply
that by thousands of backers, and we're talking about thousands of children
getting life-saving care. That's not charity theater. That's structure."
```
