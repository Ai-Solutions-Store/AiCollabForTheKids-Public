**Campaign URL:** https://aidoesitall.website
**Mission:** 60% of all revenue allocated to Verified Pediatric Charities
**Version:** Gospel V1.3 Compliant

## SECTION 3: CARRIER PARTNERSHIP MODEL

### STATE FARM & ALLSTATE INTEGRATION

**Target:** Direct partnership with carrier leadership

**Proposal Structure:**

#### Phase 1: Pilot Program (3 months)

**With single carrier:**
- Regional office (single state or region)
- 50-200 agent volunteers
- Measure: Adoption rate, referral volume, agent satisfaction

**Metrics to prove:**
- Adoption rate among pilot agents (target: 40%+)
- Average referrals per agent per month (target: 3-5)
- Client satisfaction (target: 4.5+/5)
- Zero compliance issues

#### Phase 2: Full Carrier Rollout (6 months)

**After successful pilot:**
- Carrier announces program to all agents nationally
- Co-branded landing page (carrier branding + FOR THE KIDS)
- Exclusive agent commission: 18% (higher than public offer)
- Carrier newsletter feature: 2-3 articles per quarter
- Annual carrier conference presentation

**Carrier benefit:**
- Unique differentiator vs. competitors
- Agent retention (purpose-driven business model appeals to younger agents)
- Customer retention (loyalty program angle: "renew your policy, help kids")
- Brand value (PR: "[Carrier] commits to pediatric healthcare support")
- Tax deductibility (company can contribute on behalf of agents)

### PARTNERSHIP TERMS WITH CARRIERS

**Revenue Arrangement:**
- Carrier pays no upfront fee
- FOR THE KIDS pays carrier: 2-3% of all referral volume from carrier agents
- OR: Flat annual fee ($50K-500K depending on carrier size) + revenue share

**Example Economics (State Farm):**
```
State Farm has ~18,000 independent agents

Pilot: 100 agents, 5 referrals/month each = 500 referrals
       If each referral averages $50 allocation = $25,000
       Revenue share: $25,000 × 2% = $500/month to carrier

Full rollout: 5,000 agents × 3 referrals/month = 15,000 referrals/month
              15,000 × $50 = $750,000 revenue/month
              Revenue share: $750,000 × 2% = $15,000/month to carrier
              Annual: $180,000 to carrier + brand value
```

### AGENT COMMUNICATION FROM CARRIER

**Email from carrier to agents (announcing program):**

## CONCLUSION: THE AGENT'S MISSION

Insurance agents protect families. **FOR THE KIDS lets them protect kids too.**

This isn't about guilt or obligation. It's about **alignment**.

When an insurance professional joins, they're not doing charity work. They're doing what they already do—referring clients to useful services—while getting compensated AND helping kids.

**The cycle of protection:**
- Agent protects family (insurance)
- Family uses services (through platform)
- Services fund kids (60% allocation)
- Kids get protected (medical care)
- System repeats

**Insurance protects families. FOR THE KIDS protects kids.**

**It's what insurance should be about.**
