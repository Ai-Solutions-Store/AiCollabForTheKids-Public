**Email Body:**
```
Hi [PRODUCER NAME],

I'm reaching out about a story I think would resonate with [STATION] viewers: a local tech entrepreneur who built an AI platform where 60% of all revenue is automatically allocated to verified pediatric charities through blockchain-verified smart contracts.

Story highlights:
- Joshua Coleman, [CITY] resident, created FOR THE KIDS (aidoesitall.website)
- Year 1 goal: $1.2M revenue = $720K to children's hospitals = our mission to help children
- Blockchain transparency (smart contract on Base Mainnet�fully verifiable)
- AI-generated platform (built with Claude AI assistance)
- Counternarrative to "tech greed" (founder took less to give kids more)

This hits multiple trends: AI innovation, blockchain transparency, social impact, and local entrepreneurship. Perfect for a morning segment with live demo of the platform.

Available for interview: Joshua Coleman (founder) can demonstrate the platform live and show the blockchain verification dashboard.

Would this fit [YOUR MORNING SHOW NAME]? Happy to send more details or schedule a pre-interview call.

#### **Pitch #2: Evening News (Hard News Angle)**

**Subject:** INVESTIGATIVE ANGLE: Blockchain-Verified Charity Platform Disrupts Tech

**Email Body:**
```
Hi [ASSIGNMENT EDITOR NAME],

Pitching a tech story with an investigative hook: a startup using blockchain smart contracts to prove they allocate 60% of revenue to pediatric charities�with fully public verification.

Hard news angles:
- **Transparency:** Smart contract on Base Mainnet (Planned (Q1 2026)) is public, immutable
- **Verification:** Any viewer can verify the 60/30/10 split on BaseScan (we can show this on-camera)
- **Accountability:** Unlike traditional "We allocate X%" claims, this is backend-enforced
- **Local Impact:** [CITY] founder Joshua Coleman, projecting $720K to kids' hospitals Year 1

This story tests whether blockchain can solve the "trust problem" in corporate giving. We can walk through the smart contract line-by-line with a blockchain expert for validation.

Available for on-location interview + screen recordings of BaseScan verification.

Would this work for [EVENING NEWS SHOW]? Can provide technical documentation for fact-checking.

Thanks,

### **TV SEGMENT TALKING POINTS (FOR JOSHUA COLEMAN)**

**Use this for interview prep�memorize 3-5 key points:**

#### **Opening Statement (20 seconds):**
> "We built an AI-powered business platform where 60% of all revenue is automatically allocated to verified pediatric charities. It's not a contribution�it's hardcoded into a blockchain smart contract. Literally cannot be changed by anyone."

#### **Key Point #1: The 60/30/10 Model**
> "Every dollar that comes in: 60 cents goes to children's hospitals, 30 cents reinvests in the platform, and I take 10 cents. I actually reduced my own share from 20% to 10% last month because I realized kids needed it more than I did."

#### **Key Point #2: Blockchain Transparency**
> "Here's what makes us different: you don't have to trust me. The smart contract is on Base Mainnet�fully public. Anyone can verify the 60% split at any time. We're using the same technology as cryptocurrency, but for corporate accountability."

#### **Key Point #3: Year 1 Impact**
> "We're projecting $1.2 million in revenue Year 1. That's $720,000 to verified pediatric charities. At an average cost of $2,000 per child for treatment, that's our mission to help children in our first year alone."

#### **Key Point #4: AI-Generated Platform**
> "The entire platform is built by Claude AI from Anthropic. I'm a tech entrepreneur, but I let AI do the heavy lifting. That's the future�AI building tools that actually help people."

#### **Key Point #5: BYOK Model (Bring Your Own Keys)**
> "Customers purchase software�AI chat assistants, automation tools, dating platforms�but they bring their own API keys from OpenAI, Google, or xAI. So our costs are near-zero, which means 95%+ margins flow directly to kids."

#### **Closing Statement (20 seconds):**
> "We're proving you don't have to choose between profit and purpose. You can build a real business that makes real money and still allocate most of it to kids who need it. That's the future I want to see."

---

### **INTERVIEW Q&A PREP (ANTICIPATED QUESTIONS)**

#### **Q1: "Why 60%? Why not 100%?"**
**A:** "Because we need 30% to reinvest in infrastructure�servers, marketing, scaling. And I take 10% as founder because I need to pay rent and eat. But 60% is the highest sustainable allocation. If we gave 100%, we'd go bankrupt in six months and help zero kids long-term."

---

#### **Q2: "How do I know the money actually goes to kids?"**
**A:** "Great question�that's why we use blockchain. The smart contract is at address Planned (Q1 2026) on Base Mainnet. You can open BaseScan right now, look at the contract code, and see the 60/30/10 split hardcoded. It's public, immutable, and enforced by the blockchain�not by me."

---

#### **Q3: "Which charities get the money?"**
**A:** "We're currently finalizing partnerships with verified pediatric charities�children's hospitals that meet strict criteria. Once we select a primary partner, every dollar of the 60% allocation goes there. We're looking at organizations like St. Jude, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, or regional pediatric centers. Transparency dashboard will show exactly where it goes."

---

#### **Q4: "Is this  for customers?"**
**A:** "No�and we're very clear about that. This is NOT a contribution. When customers purchase software from us, they're buying a product. We then allocate our revenue. So for customers, it's a normal business expense (which IS ), but they're not making a charitable contribution. We're the ones allocating profit."

---

#### **Q5: "What if you change your mind? What if you get greedy?"**
**A:** "I can't. That's the whole point of the smart contract. The 60/30/10 split is hardcoded on the blockchain. Even if I wanted to change it to 60/30/10 or 10/40/50, I literally cannot. The contract is immutable. The only way to change it would be to deploy a NEW contract, and then we'd lose all credibility. So there's massive reputational enforcement on top of technical enforcement."

---

#### **Q6: "How do you make money with only 10%?"**
**A:** "Two ways: First, I keep costs extremely low�no office, no employees, AI does most of the work. Second, I'm betting on scale. If we hit $10 million in revenue, 10% is $1 million�that's a great living. At $100 million, 10% is $10 million. I don't need 60% of a small company; I'd rather have 10% of a massive one."

---

#### **Q7: "Why kids? Why pediatric charities specifically?"**
**A:** "Because kids didn't choose to be sick. Adults can make lifestyle choices, but a 5-year-old with leukemia didn't do anything wrong. And pediatric care is expensive�chemotherapy, surgeries, long-term treatment. $2,000 per child can make a life-changing difference. So if I'm going to allocate 60% of revenue, it's going to kids."

---

#### **Q8: "What's your background? How'd you get into this?"**
**A:** "I spent years as an online reseller�buying undervalued items and flipping them. Then I started teaching AI to do the same thing through automation. But at some point I realized: if I'm building software that prints money, why not allocate most of it to people who need it? So FOR THE KIDS was born."

---

#### **Q9: "Do you have kids yourself?"**
**A:** "No, I don't have kids. But I think that makes this even more meaningful. I'm not doing this because my child was sick or because I have a personal connection to pediatric care. I'm doing it because it's the right thing to do. Every kid deserves a fighting chance."

---

#### **Q10: "What do you say to skeptics who think this is a marketing gimmick?"**
**A:** "Show me the blockchain. Seriously�go to BaseScan, look up our smart contract, read the code. If it's a marketing gimmick, the contract would say 10% to charity and 90% to me. But it doesn't. It says 60/30/10. And it's been that way since deployment. The blockchain doesn't lie."

#### **FOUNDER BIO (LONG VERSION)**

```
JOSHUA COLEMAN - FOUNDER, FOR THE KIDS

Joshua Coleman is a tech entrepreneur and the founder of FOR THE KIDS, an AI-powered business platform that allocates 60% of all revenue to verified pediatric charities through blockchain-verified smart contracts.

BACKGROUND:
Coleman began his career as an online reseller, buying undervalued items and flipping them for profit across platforms like eBay, Poshmark, and Facebook Marketplace. After years of manual listing and repricing, he started experimenting with AI automation to streamline the process.

THE PIVOT:
In 2025, Coleman realized that if he could build software that generated significant revenue through AI-powered tools, he could allocate the majority of that revenue to causes that mattered. Rather than follow the traditional startup path of maximizing founder equity, he chose to hardcode a 60/30/10 revenue split into a blockchain smart contract:

- 60% to verified pediatric charities
- 30% to infrastructure and reinvestment
- 10% to himself as founder

THE ETHICS OVERRIDE:
In December 2025, Coleman made a decision that stunned advisors: he reduced his own share from 20% to 10%, moving the additional 10% to the charity allocation. This "Ethics Override V1.3" became the defining moment of FOR THE KIDS�proving that the mission was more important than personal wealth.

THE PLATFORM:
FOR THE KIDS operates ai-solutions.store, selling AI-powered business tools like chat assistants, automation software, video generators, and dating platforms. The platform uses a BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) model, where customers provide their own API keys from OpenAI, Google, or xAI. This keeps operational costs near-zero, allowing 95%+ margins to flow directly to charity.

BLOCKCHAIN TRANSPARENCY:
To ensure accountability, Coleman deployed a smart contract on Base Mainnet (address: Planned (Q1 2026)) that hardcodes the 60/30/10 split. The contract is public, immutable, and verifiable by anyone�using the same technology as cryptocurrency, but for corporate governance.

THE VISION:
Coleman's goal is to scale FOR THE KIDS to $10 million in annual revenue by Year 3, which would allocate $6 million to pediatric charities�helping an estimated 3,000 children access life-saving treatments. He believes this model can be replicated across industries, proving that businesses can be both profitable and purpose-driven.

PERSONAL:
Coleman is based in [YOUR CITY, STATE] and operates as a solo founder with AI as his primary collaborator. He does not have children of his own, which makes his commitment to pediatric healthcare even more remarkable�"Every kid deserves a fighting chance, whether they're mine or not."

- "We allocate 60%" (outdated)
- "Founder gets 20%" (outdated)
- "This is a charity" (it's a for-profit LLC with allocated beneficiaries)
- " contributions" (customers purchase, we allocate)

**ALWAYS say:**
- "We allocate 60% of revenue"
- "Blockchain-verified transparency"
- "Smart contract on Base Mainnet"
- "Verified pediatric charities"
- "FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS."
