**Target: Secure 1+ committed hunter by January 7, 2026 (1 week before launch)**

#### Hunter 1: Chris Messina (@chrismessina)

Subject: Product Hunt Hunter Request - AI Platform with 60% Immutable Charity Split

Hi Chris,

I'm Joshua Coleman, founder of FOR THE KIDS. I've built something unusual that I think fits your worldview perfectly:

An AI ecosystem that mathematically allocates 60% of all profits to verified pediatric charities through backend systems (smart contract planned Q1 2026). Not promises—code.

You've spent your career advocating for how technology can serve humanity. This is that—hardcoded generosity.

Key Details:
✅ 60% to pediatric charities (backend enforced, smart contract planned Q1 2026)
✅ Multi-AI governance (Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok collaborate)
✅ 100% transparent (every transaction tracked)
✅ Open-source code (GitHub: Ai-Solutions-Store)
✅ Gospel: 14 immutable rules protecting the mission

This isn't a charity campaign—it's a for-profit AI platform where profit and purpose are mathematically inseparable.

I'm planning a Product Hunt launch on Tuesday, January 14, 2026, and would be honored if you'd consider hunting it. The tech community deserves to see what happens when you prove charity through code instead of promising it through marketing.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call?

Best,
Joshua Coleman
Founder, FOR THE KIDS
https://aidoesitall.website

P.S. ⚡ The allocation is immutable. The founder took 10% so kids get 60%. That's the opposite of unicorn incentives.

**Outreach Email (Send TODAY):**
```
Subject: Product Hunt Hunter Request - For-Profit AI Platform with Transparent Allocation

Hi Hiten,

I'm Joshua Coleman, founder of FOR THE KIDS. I'm building something I think would interest you—it's at the intersection of SaaS transparency and automated profit allocation.

The Platform:
An AI ecosystem where 60% of profits automatically flow to pediatric charities via backend systems (smart contract planned Q1 2026). Four AIs govern it. The split is immutable. Every transaction is tracked and transparent.

Why This Matters (Analytics Perspective):
- Live Jules Dashboard showing real-time revenue split
- 100% transaction transparency (dashboard tracking)
- No "accounting gimmicks"—it's mathematical
- Case study in how incentive structures drive behavior

Current Metrics:
✅ goal: help thousands of children
✅ 60/30/10 split enforced automatically
✅ Backend immutability = founder can't override it
✅ Open-source codebase (fully auditable)

I'm launching on Product Hunt on Tuesday, January 14, 2026, and would love your insight as a hunter. You understand business transparency better than anyone in the PH community.

15-minute call?

Best,
Joshua Coleman
Founder, FOR THE KIDS
https://aidoesitall.website

P.S. 💡 The 10% founder split isn't generosity theater. It's a real business model. Want to talk through the unit economics?

Subject: Product Hunt Hunter Request - Multi-AI Platform with Smart Contract Charity

Hi Bram,

I'm Joshua Coleman, founder of FOR THE KIDS. I've been impressed by your consistent presence on Product Hunt—you hunt daily and genuinely engage with makers. That's rare.

I'm building something at the intersection of AI and blockchain that I think your community would love:

FOR THE KIDS: An AI platform where four AIs (Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok) collaborate to govern a business that automatically allocates 60% of profits to pediatric charities via backend systems (smart contract planned Q1 2026).

What Makes It Interesting:
🤖 Multi-AI governance (no single AI controls it)
⛓️ Backend enforcement (no human can override)
📊 Real-time transparency dashboard (Jules)
💚 goal: help thousands of children
💻 Open-source code (GitHub: Ai-Solutions-Store)

This combines the transparency potential of blockchain + the collaborative intelligence of multi-AI systems + authentic social impact. It's a story about how technology can reshape incentive structures.

I'm launching on Product Hunt on Tuesday, January 14, 2026, and would be honored to have you hunt it. Your audience strikes the perfect balance—they care about innovation AND impact.

Interested in a quick call?

Best,

#### LinkedIn (Weekly Posts)

**Week 1 Post:**
```
After years in tech, I grew frustrated with companies that promised charitable giving but rarely delivered.

So I asked: What if we could make generosity mathematically inevitable?

The answer: Smart contracts.

FOR THE KIDS is an AI ecosystem where 60% of all profits are automatically allocated to verified pediatric charities via backend systems (smart contract planned Q1 2026).

Not a charity campaign. A for-profit business where giving is hardcoded.

Launching on Product Hunt January 14, 2026.

Follow for updates. For developers: GitHub.com/Ai-Solutions-Store

FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS.
