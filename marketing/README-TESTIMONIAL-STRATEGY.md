## GOSPEL V1.3 COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION

- [ ] **30% to infrastructure** (explicitly stated)
- [ ] **10% to founder** (NOT 20%)
- [ ] **Gospel V1.3** reference (NOT V1.2)
- [ ] **Mission alignment** language

**Example compliant statement:**
"FOR THE KIDS allocates 60% of every dollar to verified pediatric charities. 30% goes to infrastructure, 10% to founder. This isn't charity marketing—it's our entire business model, hardcoded into smart contracts."

## FINAL REMINDER: GOSPEL V1.3

Every testimonial, case study, video, and piece of social proof is an opportunity to reinforce FOR THE KIDS' radical mission:

**60% of all revenue goes directly to verified pediatric charities.**

Not 60%. Not marketing spend. Not promises to "support kids."

**60% of EVERY DOLLAR goes to kids who need medical care. This is our business model. This is immutable. This is FOR THE KIDS.**

When collecting testimonials, ask about impact. When publishing case studies, show the charity allocation. When filming videos, ask customers how they feel about profitability tied to purpose.

Social proof isn't just about conversion—it's about proving that purpose-driven business is viable at scale.

---

## FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS.

**Social proof drives conversions.
Conversions drive revenue.
Revenue (60% of it) saves kids' lives.**

Start today. Build momentum. Change the world.
