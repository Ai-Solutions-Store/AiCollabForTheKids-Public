## PRODUCT DESCRIPTION (250 words)

AI Solutions Store is a marketplace for complete, revenue-generating AI applications - not API wrappers or chatbots.

Every product is a fully-built automation engine you can deploy immediately:

**Claude Droid** - Automated video generator that converts news into YouTube Shorts. Generates 4 videos daily, handles scripting, voiceover, rendering, and uploads. Built for YouTube monetization.

**Income Droid** - Revenue-optimized video automation posting at peak engagement times (6AM, 11AM, 5PM, 9PM). Includes analytics tracking, Discord notifications, and SQLite database.

**Marketing Content Engine** - Auto-generates and publishes social media content 4x daily using Claude AI. Handles hooks, proof statements, and CTAs. Twitter/X API ready.

**Jules AI Assistant** - Gemini-powered DevOps automation. Manages Git/GitHub, Google Cloud, AWS, CI/CD pipelines, and multi-service orchestration. Business operations on autopilot.

**Affiliate System** - White-label platform with 4-tier commissions (15-30%), 90-day attribution, automated payouts, anti-fraud detection, and complete affiliate dashboard.

**YouAndINotAI Dating Platform** - Full dating app with human verification, AI-detection, matching algorithm, messaging infrastructure, and subscription billing ready.

These aren't templates or starter kits. They're complete applications with working code, integrations, and deployment guides.

**Why this matters:** Most "AI products" are ChatGPT wrappers. We sell actual automation that generates revenue, saves labor costs, and runs 24/7.

**Business model:** 60% of our profits automatically flow to verified pediatric charities through backend enforcement. Not promises - code. Every purchase helps kids while solving your business problems.

**For developers, by developers. Production-ready. Revenue-generating. Deploy today.**

## MAKER COMMENT (Post within 60 seconds of launch)

Hey Product Hunt! Joshua Coleman here, founder of AI Solutions Store.

I built this marketplace because I was tired of "AI solutions" that were just ChatGPT with a different UI.

**The Problem:** Everyone's selling AI chatbots. Nobody's selling the automation apps businesses actually need - video generators, marketing engines, DevOps automation, monetization platforms.

**The Solution:** We sell complete, working AI applications you can deploy today. Not templates. Not courses. Actual applications with real code.

**What Makes This Different:**

**These Are Real Apps:**
- Claude Droid generates 4 YouTube Shorts daily, automatically
- Income Droid posts at optimal times for maximum monetization
- Marketing Engine creates and publishes social content 4x/day
- Jules AI manages your entire DevOps workflow (Git, GCP, AWS)
- Affiliate System is white-label ready with fraud detection
- Dating Platform has human verification and anti-bot systems

**Revenue-Focused:**
Every app is designed to either generate revenue or save massive labor costs. This isn't experimental - it's practical business automation.

**Deploy Today:**
Full source code, integration guides, working APIs. You're not building from scratch - you're deploying production-ready applications.

**For Business, Not Hype:**
No blockchain buzzwords. No "revolutionary AI" marketing speak. Just automation that works and makes money.

**The Mission:**
60% of our profits automatically flow to verified pediatric charities via backend enforcement. You buy automation. Kids get helped. Math enforces the mission.

**Current Catalog:**
- Video automation (Claude Droid, Income Droid)
- Marketing automation (Content Engine)
- Business operations (Jules AI)
- Platform infrastructure (Affiliate System, Dating Platform)
- Custom development available

**What I'm Asking:**

1. **Browse the catalog:** ai-solutions.store - See actual working applications
2. **Check the code:** All apps include full source with deployment guides
3. **Ask questions:** Want to know how Claude Droid generates videos? How Jules manages DevOps? I'll explain everything.

**For Developers:**
These apps are built with production-grade code. No placeholders. No TODO comments. Claude AI audits everything before it ships. You're getting enterprise-quality automation at SaaS prices.

**For Business Owners:**
You need video content daily? Claude Droid handles it. Need social media automation? Marketing Engine runs 4x/day. Need DevOps management? Jules AI orchestrates everything. Buy the app, deploy it, profit.

**Why Now:**
AI tooling is mature enough to build real automation. But most founders are still selling chatbots. We're selling the applications businesses actually need to operate.

**Pricing:**
$199-$2,499 one-time, or monthly subscriptions. Full source code. No vendor lock-in. You own the application.

**The FOR THE KIDS Mission:**
This isn't just a marketplace - it's a mission-driven business. 60% of profits go to pediatric charities automatically. Backend enforced. You can verify at our Jules Dashboard (aidoesitall.website/dashboard). Smart contract deployment planned Q1 2026.

**TL;DR:**
- Real AI automation apps (not chatbots)
- Revenue-generating and cost-saving
- Deploy today with full source code
- Video, marketing, DevOps, platform infrastructure
- 60% of profits help kids automatically
- Built by developers, for businesses

Thanks for listening, Product Hunt. The AI hype is full of chatbots. We're selling the automation that actually matters.

Ask away. I'm reading every comment.

**FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS.**

## FAQ RESPONSES (Ready to Post)

### Q: "Is this just reselling API access?"
**A:** No. These are complete applications with custom logic, automation workflows, and deployment infrastructure. For example, Claude Droid doesn't just call an API - it has news parsing, script generation, voiceover synthesis, video rendering with FFmpeg, and YouTube OAuth upload. That's a complete system, not an API wrapper.

### Q: "Can I white-label these?"
**A:** Yes. You get full source code. Rebrand, resell, or integrate into your existing products. The Affiliate System is specifically designed for white-labeling.

### Q: "What if I'm not technical?"
**A:** Every app includes deployment guides. Most can run on basic cloud hosting ($10-20/month). We also offer deployment assistance for complex setups.

### Q: "Are there ongoing costs?"
**A:** Only the API costs for services used (OpenAI, Google Cloud, etc.). Those depend on your usage but typically $10-50/month for small-scale. No licensing fees from us.

### Q: "What's the 60% charity thing about?"
**A:** Our business model allocates 60% of profits to verified pediatric charities automatically. It's enforced by backend code (smart contract planned Q1 2026). You can verify this at our transparency dashboard. You're buying automation and helping kids simultaneously.

### Q: "Do you offer refunds?"
**A:** 30-day money-back guarantee if the code doesn't work as described. We stand behind the quality.

### Q: "Can you build custom apps?"
**A:** Yes. Custom development starts at $2,500 for simple automation, scales to $10K+ for complex platforms. Email joshlcoleman@gmail.com with your requirements.

### Q: "How is this different from hiring a developer?"
**A:** Developers cost $50-200/hour and take weeks to build automation. Our apps are production-ready today. Deploy in hours, not months. Total cost is a fraction of custom development.

## RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### For Technical Questions
"Great question! [Product name] works by [brief technical explanation]. The architecture includes [key components]. You can see the code quality in our GitHub demos or I can walk you through the specific workflow you're asking about. What's your use case?"

### For Pricing Questions
"Pricing is designed to beat the ROI of both DIY and hiring. [Product name] costs [price] one-time or [$X/month] subscription. Compare that to a developer at $75/hour (minimum 40 hours = $3K) or a SaaS tool at $99/month forever. You own the code, no vendor lock-in. What's your budget?"

### For Skeptics
"Healthy skepticism is smart. Here's how to verify: (1) Check our GitHub for code samples, (2) Review the deployment docs, (3) Ask specific technical questions - I'll answer in detail. If you're a developer, I encourage you to audit the code. We're transparent by design."

### For Feature Requests
"Love this idea! We're actively developing based on customer feedback. The roadmap prioritizes features that [generate revenue / save costs / improve automation]. I'm adding your suggestion to our list. Want to beta test when it's ready?"

### For Mission Questions
"The 60% allocation to pediatric charities is hardcoded in our backend (smart contract planned Q1 2026). You can verify live at aidoesitall.website/dashboard. This isn't marketing - it's our operating model. Gospel V1.3 makes it immutable. You buy automation, kids get helped automatically. No trust required, just math."
