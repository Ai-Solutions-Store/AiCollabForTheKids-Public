**Subject:** AI Founder Cuts Own Pay to Send More Money to Sick Kids
**Why:** Highest viral potential, feel-good story angle
**Reach:** 125,000+ subscribers

**Pitch:**
```
Dear Good News Network,

I have a story about an AI platform founder who permanently reduced his own profit share from 20% to 10% and sent the difference to pediatric charities.

FOR THE KIDS uses blockchain smart contracts to enforce a 60/30/10 revenue split: 60% to Verified Pediatric Charities, 30% to infrastructure, 10% to the founder.

"I wanted to make it impossible to break that promise - even for myself," said founder Joshua Coleman.

The smart contract has helped allocate funds supporting thousands of children. Users can verify every transaction on the blockchain.

Would you be interested in covering this story?

**Subject:** Smart Contracts Prevent Mission Drift - AI Platform Case Study
**Why:** Tech-optimist angle, innovation story
**Reach:** 80,000+ optimists

**Pitch:**
```
Hi Future Crunch,

Given your focus on positive tech innovation, thought you'd find this interesting:

FOR THE KIDS is an AI platform using smart contracts to enforce ethical commitments. Rather than relying on corporate promises, they've deployed a Solidity contract on Base Mainnet that immutably allocates 60% of revenue to pediatric charities.

The founder even reduced his own allocation from 20% to 10% via contract upgrade - a permanent decision enforced by the EVM.

This raises interesting questions about:
- Code as ethics enforcement (vs. policy/governance)
- Transparent transparency in AI companies
- Blockchain as accountability layer for AI profits

Smart contract: Planned (Q1 2026)
Platform: aidoesitall.website

Could be an interesting "good news tech" story for your readers?

Best,

**Pitch:**
```
Dear Editor,

I'm reaching out about an innovative approach to corporate giving that your readers may find newsworthy.

FOR THE KIDS (aidoesitall.website) is a for-profit AI platform that has hard-coded 60% profit allocation to Verified Pediatric Charities through blockchain smart contracts deployed on Base Mainnet. Unlike traditional CSR programs, this split is immutable and Transparently enforced.

Key story angles:
- Smart contract at Planned (Q1 2026) enforces allocation
- goal: help thousands of children to date
- Founder took 10% pay cut to increase child allocation from 50% to 60%
- DAO-based governance model prevents mission drift

Would you be interested in covering this approach to tech-enabled philanthropy?

Jack,

Given your focus on AI safety and alignment, thought you might find this approach interesting:

FOR THE KIDS is an AI platform using smart contracts to enforce ethical commitments. Rather than relying on corporate promises, they've deployed a Solidity contract on Base Mainnet that immutably allocates 60% of revenue to pediatric charities.

This raises interesting questions about:
- Code as ethics enforcement (vs. policy/governance)
- Transparent transparency in AI companies
- Blockchain as accountability layer for AI profits

The founder actually reduced his own allocation from 20% to 10% via contract upgrade - a permanent decision enforced by the EVM.

Smart contract: Planned (Q1 2026)

Could be an interesting case study for AI alignment via code constraints?

### 5. Positive News
**Email:** editorial@positive.news
**Subject:** AI Platform Uses Code to Guarantee 60% Revenue to Sick Children
**Why:** International audience, solutions journalism
**Reach:** 60,000+ (UK-focused)

**Pitch:**
```
Dear Positive News,

I'm writing about an AI platform that uses blockchain technology to guarantee charitable giving - making broken promises mathematically impossible.

FOR THE KIDS has deployed a smart contract on Base Mainnet that automatically allocates 60% of all revenue to Verified Pediatric Charities. No one - not the founder, not investors, not a future acquirer - can change this allocation.

The founder, Joshua Coleman, even reduced his own share from 20% to 10% in a permanent contract upgrade. That 10% now goes to kids instead.

Impact to date: goal: help thousands of children
Verification: Every transaction visible on blockchain at basescan.org/address/Planned (Q1 2026)

This feels like a "solutions journalism" story your readers would appreciate - tech being used to enforce ethics, not just promise it.
