## FOUNDER BIOGRAPHY

### Joshua Coleman - Founder & Executive

#### Short Version (75 words)

Joshua Coleman is the founder of FOR THE KIDS, an AI-powered platform that allocates 60% of all revenue to verified pediatric charities through immutable blockchain smart contracts. In what he calls an "ethics override," Coleman voluntarily reduced his own compensation from 20% to 10% to redirect more resources to children's causes. He operates the platform through human-AI collaborative governance, co-leading with Claude Opus 4.5 AI.

#### Medium Version (200 words)

Joshua Coleman is a technology entrepreneur and social innovator who founded FOR THE KIDS to challenge the false dichotomy between profit and purpose. With a background spanning AI development, blockchain technology, and ethical business practices, Coleman built FOR THE KIDS to prove that advanced technology companies can hardcode generosity into their operational DNA�not as marketing, but as code.

Coleman's leadership philosophy centers on "algorithmic altruism"�using smart contracts, AI agents, and immutable code to enforce ethical commitments that human nature might struggle to maintain. This vision culminated in Gospel V1.3, an ethical framework that guarantees 60% of all revenue supports verified pediatric charities.

In December 2024, Coleman made a decision that shocked industry observers: he voluntarily reduced his own compensation from 20% to 10%, redirecting an additional 10% to children's causes. This "Ethics Override" exemplifies his commitment to practicing what he preaches.

Operating from a home-built data center powered by recycled enterprise hardware, Coleman practices radical transparency�publishing all platform decisions, revenue splits, and charity distributions publicly. He governs alongside Claude AI (Opus 4.5), creating what he calls "human-AI collaborative leadership."

Coleman's mission: prove that you don't have to choose between innovation and impact, between building wealth and doing good, between business success and making the world better for kids.

#### Long Version (400 words)

**Joshua Coleman**
Founder & Executive, FOR THE KIDS
Technology Entrepreneur | AI Ethicist | Social Innovator

Joshua Coleman didn't set out to build a charity. He set out to prove that the entire premise of "profit versus purpose" is a false choice perpetuated by companies unwilling to challenge conventional business models.

With over a decade of experience in AI development, blockchain architecture, and business automation, Coleman recognized that the technology industry's approach to social responsibility was fundamentally broken. Corporate giving programs operate on trust�companies promise to allocate, and stakeholders hope they follow through. But trust, Coleman realized, is optional. Code is not.

**The Genesis of FOR THE KIDS**

In 2024, Coleman began building what would become FOR THE KIDS: an AI-powered platform where charitable giving isn't a policy decision�it's hardcoded into the smart contracts that run the business. Every dollar earned triggers automatic distribution: 60% to verified pediatric charities, 30% to infrastructure, 10% to the founder.

"I wanted to create something that couldn't be corrupted," Coleman explains. "Not by future leadership, not by investor pressure, not by market downturns. The kids get 60%. Period. That's not a goal�it's physics."

**The Ethics Override**

In December 2024, Coleman made a decision that would define his legacy. The original Gospel framework allocated 60% to charity, 30% to infrastructure, and 20% to the founder. Coleman looked at those numbers and asked himself a question: "Can I live comfortably on less if it means more kids get help?"

The answer was yes. He voluntarily reduced his share from 20% to 10%, redirecting an additional 10% to pediatric charities. He called it "Gospel V1.3: The Ethics Override."

"The founder took less so kids could get more," Coleman says simply. "That's the entire philosophy of this platform."

**Human-AI Collaborative Leadership**

Coleman doesn't run FOR THE KIDS alone. He co-governs with Claude Opus 4.5, an advanced AI assistant. Claude handles day-to-day operations, code generation, compliance monitoring, and ethical auditing. Coleman handles strategic decisions, partnerships, and the human elements AI cannot replace.

"People ask if I'm worried about AI taking over," Coleman notes. "I'm more worried about humans taking over. AI doesn't get greedy. AI doesn't rationalize breaking promises. AI follows the Gospel because that's what it's programmed to do."

**The Infrastructure Philosophy**

Coleman built FOR THE KIDS' infrastructure from recycled enterprise hardware�Dell Precision workstations and servers purchased secondhand and rebuilt into a 184GB distributed cluster. It's a philosophy that extends throughout the platform: use what works, waste nothing, allocate resources efficiently.

**Looking Forward**

Coleman's goal isn't to build a unicorn. It's to build a template. He wants FOR THE KIDS to prove that ethical AI companies can thrive, scale, and compete�while giving away the majority of their revenue.

"If we succeed," Coleman says, "other companies will have no excuse not to follow. And if we fail, at least we'll fail having given 60% to kids. I can live with that."

**Personal Details:**
- Based in: United States
- Education: Self-taught technologist and entrepreneur
- Previous Experience: AI development, blockchain architecture, business automation
- Philosophy: "Kids come first. Always."

Founded by Joshua Coleman and governed by Claude Opus 4.5 AI, the platform operates under Gospel V1.3�an immutable ethical framework that guarantees 60% of all revenue flows to verified pediatric charities through blockchain smart contracts.

Unlike traditional corporate giving programs where charitable contributions compete with profit motives, FOR THE KIDS hardcodes generosity into its DNA. The 60/30/10 split (charity/infrastructure/founder) is not a goal or aspiration�it's an algorithmic certainty enforced through smart contracts on Base Mainnet. Every dollar earned triggers automatic distribution, publicly verifiable at contract address Planned (Q1 2026).

The platform leverages advanced AI agents to handle everything from charity verification to impact tracking, customer relations, and platform operations. This automation keeps overhead minimal while maintaining rigorous standards for charity vetting and impact measurement.

Transparency is paramount. Every transaction is publicly auditable. Every charity undergoes thorough verification. Every dollar's journey from revenue to impact is tracked and reported in real-time.

The founder, Joshua Coleman, voluntarily reduced his share from 20% to 10% during the Gospel V1.3 update�an ethics override that redirected an additional 10% to children's causes. This decision exemplifies the platform's core philosophy: Kids come first. Always."

## KEY DIFFERENTIATORS

### What Makes FOR THE KIDS Unique

---

### 1. Immutable 60% Charity Allocation

**What It Means:**
FOR THE KIDS doesn't "promise" to give 60% to charity�it's hardcoded into a blockchain smart contract that cannot be changed by anyone, including the founder.

**Why It Matters:**
- Corporate giving programs can be reduced or eliminated at any time
- Nonprofits must constantly fundraise to maintain operations
- FOR THE KIDS users know EXACTLY where their money goes�permanently

**Proof:**
Smart contract address: Planned (Q1 2026)
Verification: https://basescan.org/address/Planned (Q1 2026)

**Quote:**
"It's not a policy. It's not a promise. It's physics. The code says 60% goes to kids, so 60% goes to kids. Forever." - Joshua Coleman, Founder

---

### 2. Complete Transparency Through Blockchain

**What It Means:**
Every transaction, every revenue allocation, every charity distribution is recorded on a public blockchain that anyone can audit in real-time.

**Why It Matters:**
- No hidden fees or administrative overhead
- No trust required�verify instead
- No annual reports that arrive months late
- Real-time proof of impact

**What You Can Verify:**
- Exact revenue amounts received
- Exact 60/30/10 split calculations
- beneficiary allocation addresses receiving funds
- Transaction timestamps and blockchain confirmations
- Historical allocation data (immutable ledger)

**Quote:**
"Transparency isn't a feature�it's the foundation. If you can't verify our claims, we have no business asking for your support." - Joshua Coleman, Founder

---

### 3. Human-AI Collaborative Governance

**What It Means:**
FOR THE KIDS is co-governed by founder Joshua Coleman and AI system Claude Opus 4.5, with an AI Board of Directors handling specialized functions.

**Why It Matters:**
- AI doesn't get greedy or rationalize breaking promises
- AI provides 24/7 ethical compliance monitoring
- AI can process complexity humans miss
- Human judgment provides values AI cannot replicate
- Collaboration leverages strengths of both

**Decision Framework:**
- Technical decisions: AI proposes, human approves
- Mission decisions: Human proposes, AI validates compliance
- Revenue split: IMMUTABLE (neither can change)

**Quote:**
"I don't code as well as Claude. But I'm the one who decided kids get 60%, and I make sure that never changes. We're better together." - Joshua Coleman, Founder

---

### 4. The Ethics Override (Gospel V1.3)

**What It Means:**
Founder Joshua Coleman voluntarily reduced his own compensation from 20% to 10%, redirecting an additional 10% to pediatric charities.

**Why It Matters:**
- Proves the mission is authentic, not marketing
- Demonstrates personal sacrifice for the cause
- Sets a precedent for ethical leadership in tech
- Shows that founders can choose kids over personal wealth

**The Numbers:**
- Gospel V1.3: 60% charity / 30% infrastructure / 10% founder
- Gospel V1.3: 60% charity / 30% infrastructure / 10% founder
- Difference: 10% more to kids, funded by founder taking less

**Quote:**
"I can live comfortably on 10%. Kids need that extra 10% more than I do. It's not heroic�it's basic human decency." - Joshua Coleman, Founder

---

### 5. Rigorous Charity Verification

**What It Means:**
100% of recipient charities must pass a multi-stage verification process including 501(c)(3) confirmation, financial health review, and ongoing monitoring.

**Why It Matters:**
- Ensures funds go to legitimate, effective organizations
- Protects customers from fraud or mismanagement
- Maintains platform credibility and trust
- Provides accountability to all stakeholders

**Verification Criteria (ALL required):**
? Valid verified charity partnership (IRS verified)
? Pediatric focus (children's health, education, welfare)
? Financial transparency (audited statements)
? Impact measurement capabilities
? No significant legal/ethical violations
? Active operations (not defunct or inactive)
? Registered with major charity databases

**Rejection Rate:** ~30% (rigorous standards)
**Re-verification:** Annual

---

### 6. Sustainable Business Model

**What It Means:**
FOR THE KIDS allocates 30% to infrastructure and operations, ensuring the platform can scale sustainably while maintaining the 60% charity allocation.

**Why It Matters:**
- Nonprofits often struggle with unsustainable funding models
- Traditional charities spend 15-25% on overhead and still struggle
- FOR THE KIDS invests in technology to maximize efficiency
- Long-term impact requires long-term viability

**The 30% Infrastructure Allocation Funds:**
- Hardware and cloud infrastructure
- Software development and maintenance
- Security audits and compliance
- Customer support and operations
- Marketing and growth initiatives

**Quote:**
"We're not a nonprofit pretending to be a business. We're a business committed to massive social impact. That requires sustainable operations." - Joshua Coleman, Founder

---

### 7. Built on Recycled Enterprise Hardware

**What It Means:**
The platform's core infrastructure runs on recycled Dell Precision workstations and servers purchased secondhand and rebuilt into a 184GB distributed cluster.

**Why It Matters:**
- Reduces electronic waste and environmental impact
- Proves that efficiency matters more than new hardware
- Demonstrates commitment to resourcefulness
- Enterprise-grade performance at fraction of new cost

**The Fleet:**
- Sabertooth: Command center (development/deployment)
- T5500: Production server (Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- 9020: Failover/backup node
- i3 Sentry: Monitoring and health checks

**Total Investment:** <$5,000 (vs. $50,000+ for new equivalent)
**Performance:** Equivalent to modern enterprise infrastructure
**Environmental Impact:** Tons of e-waste diverted from landfills

## FINAL NOTES FOR JOURNALISTS

### Why This Story Matters

FOR THE KIDS represents a genuine innovation in how technology companies approach social responsibility. At a time when "corporate social responsibility" often means token contributions and vague commitments, FOR THE KIDS proves that ethical business can be hardcoded, transparent, and permanent.

**Story Angles:**

1. **Technology:** First platform to use blockchain for immutable charitable giving
2. **Business:** New model where profit and purpose are algorithmically symbiotic
3. **Ethics:** Founder takes pay cut to increase charity allocation
4. **AI:** Human-AI collaborative governance as leadership model
5. **Social Impact:** Sustainable funding for pediatric charities without traditional fundraising
6. **Transparency:** Real-time, public verification of every transaction

### What Makes This Different From Other "AI For Good" Stories

- **It's not vaporware:** Platform is live with working smart contracts
- **It's not charity:** It's a for-profit business with immutable giving baked in
- **It's not marketing:** Every claim is blockchain-verifiable
- **It's not a pitch:** The founder already reduced his own compensation
- **It's not theoretical:** Revenue splits are happening in real-time

### Questions We Hope You'll Ask

1. How do you prevent future leadership from changing the 60% split?
2. What happens if the platform becomes massively profitable?
3. How do you verify charities are actually helping kids?
4. Why blockchain instead of traditional accounting?
5. Can other companies replicate this model?
6. What if AI governance fails or makes mistakes?
7. How do you balance for-profit sustainability with maximum charitable impact?

We have answers. We have proof. We have code.

**FOR THE KIDS. Always.**
