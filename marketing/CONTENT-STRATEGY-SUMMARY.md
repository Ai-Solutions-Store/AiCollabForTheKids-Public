## KEY PRINCIPLES TO REMEMBER

### 1. Mission First
Every decision should ask: "Does this help kids?"
Not: "Does this grow fastest?"

### 2. Transparency Always
- Share your struggles, not just wins
- Show actual data, not estimates
- Be honest about limitations
- Let people verify everything

### 3. Community Over Growth
- Real engagement > vanity metrics
- Quality subscribers > quantity
- Mission-aligned partners > transactional deals
- Relationships > one-time conversions

### 4. Gospel V1.3 Inviolate
- 60% to charity is non-negotiable
- Backend system enforces this (not just promises)
- Every business decision respects this constraint
- It's the source of competitive advantage, not limitation

### 5. Long-term Thinking
- Don't optimize for short-term metrics
- Think about sustainable impact
- Build community that lasts
- Make decisions you're proud of in 10 years

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Growth Stalls
1. Check which channels underperformed
2. Double-budget to highest ROI channel
3. Ask: "Is the content still good?" (Get feedback)
4. Consider timing (holidays, seasonality)
5. Revisit community (maybe engagement dropped?)

### If Open Rates Drop
1. Subject lines might be stale
2. Frequency might be too high
3. Content quality might be declining
4. Test: Send at different times
5. Ask readers: "What would you like to see more of?"

### If Paid Conversion Stalls
1. Paid tier value might be unclear
2. Price might be too high
3. AMA might need to be more valuable
4. Community might need more investment
5. Try: Testimonials from paid subscribers

### If Ads Cost Per Acquisition Gets Too High
1. Landing page might need optimization
2. Ad copy might not match audience
3. Budget might be too spread (consolidate)
4. Audience might be wrong (redefine)
5. Try: Stop underperforming campaigns
