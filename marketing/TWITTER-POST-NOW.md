### Thread Tweet 1/5 (HOOK)
**Character count:** 251

```
In December 2025, I did something radical.

I restructured our revenue model to give kids MORE.

Changed the split from 50/30/20 to 60/30/10.

Then hardcoded it so I can NEVER change my mind.

This is the story of FOR THE KIDS. 🧵

### Thread Tweet 2/5
**Character count:** 269

```
I built a 184GB RAM cluster in my home. Named the machines Sabertooth, T5500, 9020, i3 Sentry.

Then I gave Claude (Anthropic AI) full admin access to the entire codebase.

Yes. Claude runs the platform.

Why? Because AI doesn't get greedy.

AI enforces the 60%. Always.
```

### Thread Tweet 3/5
**Character count:** 248

```
Ethics Override V1.3: I took 10% LESS.

Changed founder allocation from 20% to 10%.

Gave it to the kids.

Then hardcoded it into the backend so NO ONE (not even me) can ever change it back.

$100K less per year for me.

FOR THE KIDS.

That's immutability.
```

### Thread Tweet 4/5

Federated governance. No single AI dictator.

## BONUS TWEETS (Use as needed)

### Bonus 1: Technical Deep Dive
**Character count:** 278

```
Our 60% split isn't a promise. It's immutable code.

Enforced at 4 layers:
1. Application layer (Python/Node.js)
2. Backend logic (api/server.js)
3. Database schema (PostgreSQL)
4. Gospel Constitution (immutable)

Try to change it. You can't. Nobody can.

That's code over promises.

#BuildInPublic
```

### Bonus 2: Charity Partner Focus
**Character count:** 256

```
60% of ALL revenue goes to verified pediatric charities.

Shriners Children's is our flagship partner.

Why Shriners? They help kids who can't afford care. No gatekeeping. No bureaucracy.

100+ years operating.
Direct pediatric care.
Proven track record.

#ForTheKids
```

### Bonus 3: Founder Vulnerability
**Character count:** 273

```
I used to hide my numbers.

"Revenue? That's private."
"Profit? None of your business."

Then I thought: If I'm truly FOR THE KIDS, why am I hiding?

So we published everything.

60% to charity. 30% infrastructure. 10% to me.

Hardcoded. Forever.

The scary part? This should be normal.
```

## RESPONSE TEMPLATES (Quick Reference)

**If asked "How do I know it's real?":**
```
Backend allocation logged in PostgreSQL. Every transaction tracked. Quarterly reports published. All auditable.

Full transparency: https://aidoesitall.website/transparency
```

**If asked "Which charities?":**
```
Verified pediatric charities with proven track records.

Shriners Children's is our flagship partner.

Partner selection criteria: 501(c)(3), 10+ years operating, direct child impact.

Full list: https://aidoesitall.website/charities
```

**If asked "Why only 10% founder?":**
```
I need 30% to keep servers running (AWS, APIs, infrastructure).

I need 10% to live (rent, food, family).

60% to kids? That's the maximum sustainable allocation that still lets us GROW and help MORE kids.

This is the real balance.
```

**If asked "Can I verify this?":**
```
Three ways to verify:

1. Database query: SELECT SUM(charityShare) FROM transactions
2. Backend code: Open source, auditable
3. Quarterly reports: Public record

All data is open. Come audit us.
