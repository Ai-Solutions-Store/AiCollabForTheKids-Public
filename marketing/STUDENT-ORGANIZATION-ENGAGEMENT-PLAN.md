## PART 4: RETENTION & EXPANSION STRATEGY

### Why Ambassadors Leave (& How to Prevent It)

**Reason 1: "The work isn't meaningful"**
Solution: Show impact (real children helped, real money given)
- Monthly impact dashboard (see their personal contribution)
- Quarterly impact reports (they helped 50 kids, here's proof)
- Social media features (celebrate their work)

**Reason 2: "I'm not getting paid / payment is irregular"**
Solution: Reliable, visible compensation
- Auto-pay stipends on 1st of month
- Bonus pay for referrals (track their personal link)
- Public leaderboard (top earners get recognized)

**Reason 3: "No one cares / this isn't helping the org"**
Solution: Integration with organization goals
- Results dashboard (orgs see impact too)
- Commission split (org gets funding + ambassadors get stipends)
- Co-branded recognition (give credit to the org)

**Reason 4: "This is low-effort but feels like a lot of commitment"**
Solution: Make it actually low-effort
- Pre-written social posts (copy/paste)
- Monthly 30-min meeting (all info provided)
- Optional extras (don't require advanced participation)

**Reason 5: "I'm graduating / changing schools"**
Solution: Plan for turnover + celebrate transitions
- Recruit replacement ambassadors (current ones help onboard)
- Alumni ambassador status (stay connected, lower commitment)
- Job offer (top ambassadors can interview for roles)

---

### Retention KPIs & Targets

| Metric | Target | How to Achieve |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Month 2 retention | 70%+ | Good onboarding, clear expectations |
| Month 4 retention | 60%+ | Monthly recognition, payment, impact updates |
| Month 6 retention | 60%+ | Renewal offer, new opportunities, community |
| Annual retention | 40%+ | Career pathway, advancement opportunities |

---

### Expansion Playbook

Once one organization is successful:

1. **Ask for referral** (Week 1)
   - "Are there other orgs on campus that would care about this?"
   - Get warm intro to club president
   - Mention: "Club X is doing this successfully"

2. **Case study** (Week 2)
   - "Here's what Club X accomplished in 6 weeks..."
   - Share metrics (# ambassadors, revenue, impact)
   - Share testimonial from Club X president

3. **Faster onboarding** (Week 3)
   - Lessons from first org apply to new one
   - Standard templates, known process
   - Reuse materials (save time)

4. **Network effects** (Month 2)
   - Ambassadors from different orgs meet
   - They realize they're all doing same thing
   - Create org-level competitions (friendly)
   - Cross-promote across social channels

---

6. Testimonials & success stories

---

## PART 6: BUDGET & FINANCIAL PLANNING

### Cost Per Organization

```
Ambassador Stipends: $100-300/month × 15 ambassadors = $1,500-4,500/month
Event Support: $200-500/month (snacks, materials, prizes)
Management: 5 hours/month × $50/hr = $250/month
Total Per Org: $1,950-5,250/month ($24K-63K/year)
```

### Revenue Per Organization

```
Conservative:
- 100 new students per org
- $150 average LTV
- Total: $15,000 per org

Aggressive:
- 300 new students per org
- $200 average LTV
- Total: $60,000 per org

Realistic: $25,000-40,000 per org annually
Charity impact (60%): $15,000-24,000 per org
```

### Unit Economics

```
Cost to activate org: $5,000 (one-time)
Annual cost to maintain: $35,000 (average)
Annual revenue: $35,000 (conservative)
Charity impact: $21,000

Year 1 ROI: -$5,000 (investment year)
Year 2+ ROI: 0% (break-even, but mission-driven)

But when you aggregate 10 orgs = $350K revenue = $210K to charity
```
