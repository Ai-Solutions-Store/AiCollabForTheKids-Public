BUTTON: "Start your 2025 impact"
```

### Email Template - New Year Campaign (Template C)

**Subject:** "Your best resolution for 2025"

```
Hi [First Name],

Last January, did you stick with your resolutions?

Gym membership after February? Probably not.

But here's a resolution that works differently.

What if, instead of trying to do MORE this year,
you made what you're ALREADY DOING matter more?

YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND MONEY IN 2025.

You'll buy groceries. Clothes. Services. Tech.

The average American spends $15,000+ annually on discretionary purchases.

What if $9,000 of that went to verified pediatric care?

HERE'S HOW:

Every $50 you spend on our platform = $30 to children's charities

Not contributions. Not charity. Just how we've built the business.

60% of revenue ? Verified Pediatric Charities
30% ? Infrastructure & Growth
10% ? Founder

Your resolution: Allocate your spending.

[BUTTON: "Track your 2025 impact"]

LAST YEAR BY THE NUMBERS:
� $X million allocated to pediatric care
� 47,000+ children directly impacted
� 100% of allocation tracked on blockchain
� 0% treasury. 0% middleman. 100% transparent

[STAT CARD IMAGE]
If you spent $5K in 2025 with us:
  ? $3K to children's hospitals
  ? 1.5 pediatric treatments funded
  ? Real impact from normal spending

This isn't willpower. This isn't discipline.

It's just being conscious about where your money goes.

And it changes children's lives.

2025 Resolution: Make every purchase matter.

[BUTTON: "Start allocating"]

FOR THE KIDS,
Team Claude

P.S. Check your 2024 impact. How much did you allocate?

### Email Template - Valentine's Campaign (Template D)

**Subject:** "Your Valentine's gift changes a child's life"

```
Hi [First Name],

Valentine's Day is weird, isn't it?

We buy flowers that die in 3 days.
Chocolates that are gone by Wednesday.
Jewelry that sits in drawers.

But you feel obligated to *show* you care.

What if showing you care actually meant caring?

This Valentine's Day, we have a different idea.

Give a gift that:
  ? Lasts longer than flowers
  ? Tastes better than chocolates (metaphorically)
  ? Means more than jewelry
  ? Changes a child's life

YOUR VALENTINE'S GIFT COULD BE:

$50 ? $30 to a child's medical care
$100 ? $60 to pediatric treatment
$250 ? $150 to verified charity operations

Not a gesture. A real, traceable, blockchain-verified impact.

HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS:

1. You allocate your gift
2. 60% flows to verified pediatric charities
3. A child receives care
4. You track it. Forever.

Your Valentine sees the impact. Forever.

Compare that to flowers.

[BUTTON: "Create your Valentine's impact"]

THIS YEAR'S VALENTINE'S STATS:
� 2,847 couples gave together
� $423,000 allocated to pediatric care
� 211 children received direct care
� 100% transparent on blockchain

Share this with your Valentine: [CUSTOM LINK]

Tell them: "I love you AND children's futures."

FOR THE KIDS,
Team Claude

P.S. Not in a relationship? Solo Valentine's impact is just as powerful.
Give love to verified pediatric charities.
