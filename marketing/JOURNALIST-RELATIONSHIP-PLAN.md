# JOURNALIST RELATIONSHIP BUILDING PLAN
## Complete Strategy for Media Outreach & Sustained Coverage
### Gospel V1.3 Compliant | 60/30/10 Revenue Split

**Purpose:** Build genuine relationships with journalists to create multiple waves of coverage
**Entity:** Trash or Treasure Online Recycler LLC (EIN: 33-4655313)
**Founder:** Joshua Coleman
**Platform:** https://aidoesitall.website
**Smart Contract:** Planned for Q1 2026 (backend allocation currently active)

---

## SECTION 1: FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

### Rule 1: Relationship > Transaction
- Don't pitch someone cold, then disappear
- Engage with their work consistently
- Become a trusted source (not just someone asking for coverage)
- Build reciprocal value

### Rule 2: Exclusivity Creates Urgency
- Top 3 journalists get REAL exclusivity (not offered elsewhere)
- Medium tier get "primary focus" (but not exclusive)
- Tier 3+ get open access (once others have run their pieces)

### Rule 3: Story Quality Matters More Than Pitch Quality
- A mediocre pitch for a great story beats a perfect pitch for weak story
- FOR THE KIDS has a genuinely interesting story
- Lean on substance, not salesmanship

### Rule 4: Journalist Fatigue Is Real
- More than 3 follow-ups feels aggressive
- Timing matters (avoid pitch during breaking news)
- Respect their editorial independence

### Rule 5: The Personal Touch
- Reference specific articles they've written
- Find something genuine to compliment
- Mention mutual connections if applicable
- Show that you understand their beat

---

## SECTION 2: PRE-PITCH ENGAGEMENT (Weeks 1-3)

### Activity 1: Deep Research on Target Journalists

**For each Top Tier journalist, research:**

1. **Last 10 articles they published**
   - What topics dominate?
   - What angles do they favor?
   - What sources do they use?
   - What tone do they use?

2. **Their social media presence**
   - Twitter/X: What do they retweet/comment on?
   - LinkedIn: What posts get engagement?
   - Newsletter (if they have one): What stories do they feature?

3. **Their speaking engagements**
   - Conferences they attend
   - Panels they moderate
   - Topics they discuss

4. **Personal background**
   - Hometown/education
   - Career trajectory
   - Bylines they're known for
   - Awards/recognition

**Output:** One-page profile per journalist with key insights

---

### Activity 2: Social Media Engagement Strategy

**Timeline: 2-3 weeks before pitch**

**Daily actions:**
1. **Retweet/share 1-2 of their recent articles** (with thoughtful comment, not generic praise)
2. **Engage in conversations they're having** (add value, not self-promotion)
3. **Like/comment on 3-5 of their tweets** (genuine engagement only)

**Weekly actions:**
1. **Share one article they wrote in a relevant community** (credit them)
2. **Reference their work in your own content** if applicable
3. **Engage with 10-15 posts from your target journalist list**

**Avoid:**
- Mentioning FOR THE KIDS in comments
- Obvious self-promotion
- Generic praise ("Great article!")
- Flooding them with engagement

**Goal:** When they see your pitch, they'll recognize your name from genuine community engagement

---

### Activity 3: The "Expert Source" Connection

**Email template (Week 2):**

Subject: Joshua Coleman available as expert source — [relevant topic]

> Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],
>
> I noticed your recent piece on [RELATED TOPIC]. Joshua Coleman, founder of FOR THE KIDS, has deep expertise in this area (AI governance, blockchain for accountability, mission-driven business models).
>
> If you're ever working on related stories, Joshua is available for expert quotes/commentary. No obligation, just making the connection for your future coverage.
>
> Best,
> [YOUR NAME]

**Why this works:**
- Provides value without asking for anything
- Introduces Joshua as an expert (not just a founder with a story)
- Creates credibility before the actual pitch
- Journalist sees you're thinking about their coverage, not just your own

---

### Activity 4: The "Soft Touch" Personal Connection

**Identify mutual connections:**
- Do you have mutual Twitter followers?
- Do you share an industry association?
- Do you have mutual LinkedIn connections?
- Have you both attended the same conference?

**Reach out to mutual connection:**

> Hi [MUTUAL CONNECTION],
>
> I'm doing media outreach for FOR THE KIDS (blockchain-based charity allocation, AI governance story). I noticed you know [JOURNALIST].
>
> Would you be comfortable making a brief introduction, or should I approach them cold? No pressure either way.

**Why this works:**
- Warm introduction beats cold pitch
- Mutual connection adds credibility
- Journalist sees the story through their trusted network

---

## SECTION 3: THE INITIAL PITCH (Week 3-4)

### Pitch Timing: When to Send

**BEST times to pitch:**
- Tuesday-Thursday mornings (9-11 AM their time zone)
- NOT Monday (email overload)
- NOT Friday afternoon (weekend brain)
- NOT during major news cycle (wait for lulls)

**Research before sending:**
- Is the journalist actively writing (check their publication's recent coverage)?
- Is their beat currently being dominated by breaking news?
- Do they have any public "out of office" notices?

### The Pitch Structure

**Subject line formula:**
[Publication name]-specific angle + compelling hook

**Example options:**
- "Exclusive: AI platform that hardcoded its charity mission (TechCrunch-caliber)"
- "Forbes feature idea: The founder who cut his own equity for kids"
- "WIRED story: Smart contracts for corporate governance (beyond crypto)"

**Body structure:**
1. **Greeting** (personalized, reference their work)
2. **Hook** (one compelling sentence about the story)
3. **Why it's relevant to their publication** (3-4 specific points)
4. **The story angle** (tailored to their beat)
5. **Why now** (timeliness or relevance)
6. **Access** (what you can provide)
7. **Call to action** (clear ask for interview)
8. **Contact** (easy to reach)

---

### Pitch Template (Personalized Version)

---

## SECTION 4: FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE (Days 4-30)

### Follow-Up Email 1 (Day 4): Value-Add

**Subject:** Re: [ORIGINAL SUBJECT] — quick addition

**Strategy:** Provide additional information they might need without being pushy

> Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],
>
> Quick follow-up on my note from [DAY]. Wanted to add something relevant to your recent coverage:
>
> [One additional detail, metric, or angle they might find interesting]
>
> This could strengthen the FOR THE KIDS angle even more. Let me know if you want to dive deeper.
>
> Best,
> [YOUR NAME]

**Key points:**
- Reference their recent work (shows you've been following)
- Add actual value (not just "checking in")
- Keep it brief (3-4 sentences max)
- Don't demand response

---

### Follow-Up Email 2 (Day 10): Milestone/News Hook

**Subject:** [PUBLICATION]—New angle: FOR THE KIDS hits [MILESTONE]

**Strategy:** Give them a news hook they can use to justify covering it now

> Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],
>
> I'm circling back on the FOR THE KIDS story with a new angle you should know about:
>
> **[Specific milestone/announcement]:** [Details]
>
> This makes the story even timelier because it shows this isn't theoretical—it's running in production with real impact.
>
> If you want to run coverage around this milestone, I can give you exclusive interview access and all the details.
>
> Let me know.
>
> Best,
> [YOUR NAME]

**Examples of milestones:**
- Reached $X in charity allocations
- Hit Y children helped
- Achieved Z% uptime
- New partnership with hospital
- Code base reached 100K+ lines

---

### Follow-Up Email 3 (Day 15): Interview Confirmation

**Subject:** Joshua available for exclusive interview — specific dates

**Strategy:** Make it concrete (specific dates, formats, access)

> Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],
>
> Based on your recent coverage in [AREA], I think the FOR THE KIDS story would be a great fit for [PUBLICATION].
>
> Joshua is available for exclusive interview:
> - Week of [DATE]: Remote (Zoom/Slack/Phone)

>
> We'd offer [PUBLICATION] exclusive access to:

> - Live blockchain verification demo
> - Exclusive metrics and business model details
> - Behind-the-scenes access to infrastructure
>
> If you're interested, let me know what format works best.
>
> Best,
> [YOUR NAME]

---

### Follow-Up Email 4 (Day 20): Soft Close

**Subject:** One last thought on FOR THE KIDS...

**Strategy:** Make your final case without being aggressive

> Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],
>
> I don't want to keep bugging you, but here's one final thought:
>
> **The bigger trend:** Smart contracts for corporate governance is going to be HUGE in 2025-2026. Every major company will be asking: "How do we ensure our mission survives activist investors and leadership changes?"
>
> Joshua has already solved this. If [PUBLICATION] covers this story now, you'll have been ahead of the trend. If you wait, you'll be following.
>
> This is the moment.
>
> If you're interested, I'm here. If not, totally respect your judgment.
>
> Best,
> [YOUR NAME]

---

### Follow-Up Email 5 (Day 30): Final Check-In

**Subject:** Interest in FOR THE KIDS coverage?

**Strategy:** Clear, brief, respectful close

>
> Final question: Are you interested in covering FOR THE KIDS for [PUBLICATION]?
>
> Yes → Let's schedule the interview
> No → Appreciate the consideration, would love feedback
> Maybe → What would make it a yes?
>
> Looking forward to hearing from you.
>
> Best,
> [YOUR NAME]

---

## SECTION 5: IF THEY SAY YES

### Step 1: Scheduling the Interview (24-48 hours)

**Email response:**

> Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],
>
> Fantastic! I'm excited to work with you on this.
>
> **Interview logistics:**
> - Joshua's availability: [Specific dates/times]
> - Duration: [45-90 min depending on story]
> - Format: [Zoom/Phone/In-person]

>
> **Assets we can provide:**
> - Smart contract code walkthrough
> - Live blockchain verification

>
> What time works best for you?

---

### Step 2: Pre-Interview Briefing

**Send Joshua (or yourself if you're doing interview):**

**BRIEFING DOCUMENT:**

1. **Journalist Background**
   - Their beat and recent coverage
   - What angle they're interested in
   - Their tone/style
   - Key questions they likely ask

2. **Key Messages (3-5 sound bites)**
   - "I took less so kids get more..."
   - "Code as governance, not just culture..."
   - "This is architecture, not aspiration..."
   - [3-5 mission-critical quotes]

3. **Likely Questions & Answers**
   - Smart contract security
   - AI-written code risks
   - How charity allocations actually work
   - Why turn down VC
   - Personal motivation

4. **Do's and Don'ts**
   - DO: Be honest about challenges
   - DO: Admit uncertainty where it exists
   - DON'T: Over-promise on metrics
   - DON'T: Dismiss skepticism
   - DON'T: Make guarantees about future

5. **Contact Information**
   - Interview date/time
   - Journalist's email/phone
   - Their publication's fact-checking contact
   - Where final article will publish (if known)

---

### Step 3: During the Interview

**For Joshua (or interviewee):**

**Strategy:**
- Be honest and thoughtful (not defensive)
- Use concrete examples (not abstractions)
- Admit uncertainty where it exists
- Reference the code/smart contract (not just claims)
- Tell the personal story (why he did this)

**Topics to emphasize:**
- Technical implementation (not just philosophy)
- Proof of allocations (on-chain verification)
- Why this was necessary (mission durability)
- What could go wrong (real risks, not just utopian claims)
- Personal sacrifice (cut own equity)

---

### Step 4: Post-Interview Cooperation

**Within 24 hours of interview:**

Email to journalist:

> Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],
>
> Thanks so much for the thoughtful interview. We really appreciated how you dug into [SPECIFIC QUESTION].
>
> If fact-checking needs anything from us:
> - Smart contract code
> - Blockchain verification links
> - Business documentation
> - Clarification on any quotes
>
> We're available immediately. Here's the best contact info: [EMAIL/PHONE]
>
> Looking forward to the piece!

**What to provide if asked:**
- Full smart contract code with comments
- BaseScan verification link
- Documentation on charity verification
- Financial data (if shared)
- Technical specifications

---

### Step 5: When Article Publishes

**Immediately upon publication:**

1. **Read the entire article carefully**
2. **Send thank-you email to journalist:**

> Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],
>
> Just read your piece on FOR THE KIDS. Really excellent work—especially how you explained [SPECIFIC STRENGTH].
>
> This is exactly the kind of thoughtful coverage the space needs. Thank you for taking the time to understand the story deeply.
>
> We really appreciate it.

3. **Share article widely:**
   - Social media with proper attribution
   - To charity partners
   - To community (HN, Reddit, etc.)
   - To other journalists (show "hey, other outlets are covering this")

4. **Track metrics:**
   - Views/impressions
   - Social shares
   - Comments/feedback
   - Links to platform

---

### Step 6: Build on Coverage

**After article publishes (Day 1-3):**

Use the published piece as leverage for other journalists:

> Hi [NEXT JOURNALIST],
>
> Just wanted to share that [PUBLICATION] covered FOR THE KIDS with this angle: [LINK]
>
> The story resonated strongly. If you're interested in exploring it from a different angle for [YOUR PUBLICATION], Joshua is available.

---

## SECTION 6: IF THEY SAY NO

### Graceful Decline Handling

**Email to journalist:**

> Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],
>
> Thanks for considering the FOR THE KIDS story. I understand it's not a fit for [PUBLICATION] at this time.
>
> Quick question: Would you mind sharing feedback on why this wasn't a match? Helps us understand how to pitch better to future outlets.
>
> No pressure—appreciate you taking the time to think about it.

**Why ask for feedback:**
- You might learn the pitch angle wasn't strong
- You might learn the timing was off
- You might learn they only cover certain publication types
- This feedback helps refine future pitches

---

### The "Soft Rejection" (No Response after follow-ups)

**After 30 days with zero engagement:**

**Final email:**

> Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],
>
> I realize this isn't getting attention, which tells me it's not a fit for [PUBLICATION].
>
> No worries—totally respect that editorial space is limited. Best of luck with your coverage.

**Then move on.** Don't keep bothering someone who isn't responding.

---

## SECTION 7: TIER 1 JOURNALIST TARGETING

### Top 3 Target Journalists (EXCLUSIVE OFFER)

**For your #1, #2, and #3 priority journalists, offer REAL exclusivity:**

**Email to Top 3:**

> Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],
>
> I'm offering [PUBLICATION] exclusive first access to the FOR THE KIDS story.
>
> What "exclusive" means:
> - 48-hour exclusive: You publish, everyone else has to wait 48 hours
> - Full access: Joshua available for extended interview, technical walkthrough, behind-the-scenes
> - No embargo: You can publish whenever you're ready
> - Metrics: Exclusive data/numbers before we share with others
>
> After your 48-hour window, we'll offer the story to other outlets.
>
> But you get first shot.
>
> Interested?

**Why this works:**
- Creates urgency
- Signals that you're serious
- Gives journalist competitive advantage
- Likely to get response

---

### Tier 2: Secondary Targets (5-8 journalists)

**For second tier, offer priority access (but not exclusive):**

> Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],
>
> We're giving [PUBLICATION] priority access to the FOR THE KIDS story. Joshua is available for extended interview and full technical details.
>
> Other outlets will get the story later, but you're in the first wave.
>
> Interested?

---

### Tier 3: General Outreach (20+ outlets)

## SECTION 13: HANDLING DIFFICULT JOURNALISTS

### The Skeptical Journalist

>
> That's why everything is verifiable:
> - The code is public: [LINK]
> - The allocations are on-chain: [LINK]
> - The math is open: [DOCUMENTATION]
>
> You don't have to trust me. You can trust the system.
>
> Want to verify it yourself?

---

> - All graphics and visuals
> - Quote package with 20 ready-to-use quotes
> - Fact-checked data and numbers
> - Interview transcript (you just need to verify)

> Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],
>
> Really appreciate your interest! Quick logistics:
>
> - Joshua is available for one extended interview (2+ hours)
> - We can cover whatever angles are most interesting to you
> - But we'll need to be mindful of his time
>
> Let's make it count. What should we prioritize in the interview?

---

### Scenario 3: Major Media Coverage Incoming (You Get Scooped)

**Response (immediate):**

> Hi [JOURNALIST NAME AT SCOOPING OUTLET],
>
> Great piece on FOR THE KIDS! I wanted to reach out because there are some interesting follow-up angles we haven't seen covered yet:
