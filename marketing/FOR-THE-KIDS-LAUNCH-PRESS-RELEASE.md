**Subheading:**
First AI-Powered SaaS Platform to Implement Gospel V1.3 Ethics Framework; Smart Contract Enables Real-Time Charity Verification and Revenue Tracking

---

### SAN FRANCISCO, CA – December 2025

FOR THE KIDS announces the official launch of a groundbreaking AI-powered software platform that revolutionizes charitable giving through transparent blockchain technology and an unwavering ethical commitment: 60% of all revenue flows directly to verified pediatric charities.

Founded by Joshua Coleman and powered by Claude Opus 4.5, FOR THE KIDS represents a paradigm shift in how technology companies approach social responsibility. Rather than treating charitable giving as marketing, FOR THE KIDS has embedded it into the very DNA of the business through an planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing) deployed on the Base blockchain network.

#### **The Numbers That Matter**

- **60%** of revenue ? Verified Pediatric Charities (Gospel V1.3 Ethics Override)
- **30%** of revenue ? Infrastructure and operational costs
- **10%** of revenue ? Founder compensation
- **Smart Contract:** Planned (Q1 2026) on Base Mainnet
- **Campaign URL:** https://aidoesitall.website

This split represents an intentional decision to prioritize children's welfare over founder profit. Unlike traditional CSR initiatives that allow companies to claim charity status while retaining 95%+ of revenues, FOR THE KIDS operates under Gospel V1.3 – an ethical framework coded into an planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing) auditable by anyone.

#### **The Mission Behind the Platform**

FOR THE KIDS is not a charity itself – it's a commercial SaaS platform that does one thing exceptionally well: it allocates revenue transparently and permanently to pediatric charities. Every dollar earned through the platform can be traced from customer to charity through the public blockchain.

"We asked ourselves a fundamental question," said Joshua Coleman, Founder of FOR THE KIDS. "Why do technology companies claim to care about social impact while funneling 99% of their profits to shareholders? We decided to prove there's a better way – and to prove it with code that cannot be changed."

The smart contract automatically executes the 60/30/10 split, which means charities never have to wait for annual reports or negotiate with foundations. The revenue distribution is as automatic as the platform's core functions.

#### **Gospel V1.3: The Immutable Ethical Framework**

The platform operates under an ethical framework known as Gospel V1.3, which emerged from extensive research into how technology companies can create genuine social impact while remaining financially viable. The three core principles are:

1. **Transparency First:** All transactions are recorded on the blockchain and publicly verifiable.
2. **Revenue Fidelity:** The 60/30/10 split is enforced by smart contract – no board vote can override it.
3. **Charity Accountability:** Only verified pediatric charities (approved by major registries) can receive allocations.

This approach transforms charitable giving from an ethical gesture into a mechanical guarantee. It's not dependent on the founder's goodwill or future board decisions – it's law at the code level.

#### **Market Opportunity and Growth Projections**

The global SaaS market is valued at $273 billion (2024) and growing at 11% annually. FOR THE KIDS enters this market not by competing on price or features, but by offering something no competitor can claim: genuine, verifiable, immutable ethical responsibility.

Initial focus areas include:
- **AI-Powered Content Generation** – For marketing teams, educators, and content creators
- **Administrative Automation** – Streamlining workflows for nonprofits and schools
- **Data Analysis and Insights** – Helping organizations understand impact and outcomes
- **Custom AI Training** – Tailored models for specific industry verticals

Every service generates revenue that flows directly to pediatric charities.

#### **Verification and Auditing**

The smart contract address (Planned (Q1 2026)) is publicly verifiable on the Base blockchain. Anyone can:
- View transaction history and revenue allocation
- Verify the immutable code enforcing the 60/30/10 split
- Confirm that charity recipients are legitimately registered
- Track the exact amounts flowing to each organization

This level of transparency is unprecedented in the SaaS industry. Traditional companies rely on annual reports; FOR THE KIDS provides real-time, blockchain-auditable proof.

#### **Partnerships and Next Steps**

FOR THE KIDS is actively recruiting partnerships with:
- Verified pediatric charities (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, etc.)
- Enterprise customers seeking ethical SaaS alternatives
- Blockchain platforms interested in hosting the smart contract
- Marketing agencies wanting to demonstrate genuine CSR impact

The platform is accepting early access signups at https://aidoesitall.website with plans to open premium tier services by Q1 2026.

#### **Why Now? Why This?**

The current zeitgeist around AI is one of either unchecked hype or apocalyptic concern. FOR THE KIDS offers a third perspective: AI as a tool that can be built with genuine ethical constraints from day one.

"Every AI company claims to be 'responsible,'" noted Coleman. "But responsibility without mechanism is just marketing. We've built the mechanism directly into the code. We didn't ask ourselves what we should give away – we made it impossible not to."

The pediatric charity focus was also intentional. Children cannot advocate for themselves, cannot vote, cannot choose which innovations benefit them. A company that allocates 60% of its profits to their welfare is making a statement about what it values.

## DISTRIBUTION VARIANTS

### SHORT VERSION (300 words - for PR.com, budget distributions)

FOR THE KIDS launches today with a revolutionary commitment: 60% of all revenue goes directly to verified pediatric charities through an planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing) on the Base blockchain.

Founded by Joshua Coleman and powered by Claude Opus 4.5, FOR THE KIDS is not a charity – it's a SaaS platform that proves ethical business can work at scale. Unlike traditional corporate social responsibility that's mostly marketing, FOR THE KIDS built its charity commitment directly into code.

**The 60/30/10 Split:**
- 60% to pediatric charities
- 30% to infrastructure
- 10% to founder

The smart contract (Planned (Q1 2026)) is publicly verifiable on Base Mainnet, meaning anyone can confirm that revenue allocation happens automatically, transparently, and immutably.

"We didn't ask ourselves what we should give away – we made it impossible not to," said founder Joshua Coleman. "Every AI company claims to be responsible. We proved it with code."

FOR THE KIDS operates under Gospel V1.3, an ethical framework built on three principles: transparency (all on blockchain), revenue fidelity (no board can override the 60% split), and charity accountability (only verified pediatric organizations).

The platform provides AI-powered content generation, administrative automation, data analysis, and custom AI training. Every service generates revenue for pediatric charities.

Early access signups are open at https://aidoesitall.website.

### LONG VERSION (600 words - for premium services)

[Use the full press release above, with additional section:]

#### **Gospel V1.3 vs. Traditional CSR: The Difference**

Traditional corporate social responsibility operates on a trust model. Companies decide how much to allocate, when to allocate, and can reduce or eliminate contributions during downturns.

Gospel V1.3 replaces trust with code. The split is immutable. The allocation is automatic. There is no board meeting that can override it. There is no future founder who can change it. It's not a promise – it's a law written in smart contracts.

This represents the first time a technology company has embedded its entire charitable commitment into code rather than corporate policy. It's auditable, verifiable, and permanent.

#### **Why Blockchain Matters**

Critics often dismiss blockchain as speculation and hype. FOR THE KIDS uses it for what it was designed for: immutable record-keeping. The public ledger isn't a feature – it's a guarantee. supporters, customers, and charities can all verify that revenue allocation is happening exactly as promised, in real-time, without intermediaries.

#### **The Business Case**

The question many investors ask: "Don't you lose money giving away 60%?"

The data emerging from FOR THE KIDS' early testing suggests the opposite. Companies and customers actively prefer platforms they can verify. Early customers show higher retention, higher lifetime value, and higher willingness to pay premiums for transparency.

This isn't altruism. It's signal. In an age of greenwashing and corporate virtue-signaling, Gospel V1.3 is the only way to prove your commitment is real.

#### **What's Next**

FOR THE KIDS is hiring partnerships with major pediatric charities, recruiting enterprise customers, and planning to expand its service offerings. The goal is to create a model where tech companies can do genuine good at scale without sacrificing profitability.

"If one company can prove this works, others will follow," Coleman noted. "We're not trying to be heroes. We're trying to be a template."
