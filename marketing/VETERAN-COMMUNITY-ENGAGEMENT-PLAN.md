   - You commit 3-5% of quarterly revenue to FOR THE KIDS
   - We handle the rest: marketing, impact tracking, recognition
   - 60% reaches pediatric charities
   - You get tax deduction + peace of mind

   This isn't about charity. It's about legacy. What business do you want
   to leave behind?

   Interested in 30 minutes to discuss?
