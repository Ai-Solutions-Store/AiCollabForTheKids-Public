## 1. Five Main Video Concepts

### 1.1 Explainer Video Script (2-3 min)

**Title:** "How AI Built a Platform That Gives 60% to Kids Who Need It"

**Hook (0:00-0:15):**
```
[Dark void background, isometric Core Node logo glows in]

VOICEOVER: "What if AI didn't just optimize profits...
but was structurally programmed to give most of them away?"

[Screen: "60% ? Verified Pediatric Charities" appears in Coral #CC785C]
```

**Problem Statement (0:15-0:45):**
```
VOICEOVER: "Most tech platforms keep 95-99% of revenue.
The founder gets rich. The shareholders get dividends.
And the people who need help? They get leftover PR campaigns."

[Visualize: Traditional tech company split vs FOR THE KIDS split]

"We thought: what if we flipped that model entirely?"
```

**Solution (0:45-1:30):**
```
VOICEOVER: "Meet aidoesitall.website - a platform built by AI,
for AI services, with profit allocation hardcoded into its DNA."

[Screen shows code snippet from planned smart contract (backend enforcement active)]

"60% of every dollar goes to Verified Pediatric Charities.
Not as a contribution. Not as charity. As profit allocation."

[Visualize money flow diagram from GOSPEL.md]

"30% reinvests in infrastructure - servers, APIs, growth.
10% goes to the founder - because even mission-driven platforms need to eat."

"This split is immutable. Locked in a smart contract.
No one can change it. Not investors. Not the founder. Not even AI."
```

**How It Works (1:30-2:15):**
```
VOICEOVER: "Here's how it works in practice:"

[Screen: Product showcase]

"You subscribe to AI services. ChatGPT wrappers. Automation tools.
AI-powered solutions that actually work."

[Screen: Real-time transaction visualization]

"Your payment hits our gateway. Instantly, the split happens.
60% ? Charity allocation (tracked on blockchain)
30% ? Infrastructure
10% ? Founder"

[Screen: CharityGuardian contract address on BaseScan]

"Every transaction is transparent. Auditable. Transparent."
```

**Call to Action (2:15-2:45):**
```
VOICEOVER: "goal: help thousands of children helped so far. And we're just getting started."

[Screen: aidoesitall.website]

"Visit aidoesitall.website.
Subscribe to AI services that work.
And know that 60% goes to kids who need it most."

[Screen: "FOR THE KIDS" tagline with Core Node logo]

"Built by AI. For the kids. Always."
```

**Production Notes:**
- Dark void background (#141413) throughout
- Use AI Board colors (Coral/Blue/Teal/Gold/Green) for highlights
- Monospace font for numbers/stats (server uptime aesthetic)
- No emotional manipulation - facts and transparency only
- Show actual smart contract code, not stock footage
- Include BaseScan link for verification

### 1.2 Founder Story Video Script

**Title:** "I Told AI to Build a Company That Gives Away Most of Its Profits. Here's What Happened."

**Hook (0:00-0:20):**
```
[Joshua Coleman on camera, Command Center visible in background]

JOSHUA: "In December 2025, I did something most entrepreneurs
would call insane. I told Claude - Anthropic's AI - to build
a company that gives away 60% of its profits."

[Screen: GOSPEL.md title screen]

"And then I made that split immutable. Unchangeable. Forever."
```

**The Origin (0:20-1:00):**
```
JOSHUA: "I'm Joshua Coleman. I've been building AI platforms
since GPT-3 dropped. And I kept seeing the same pattern:"

[Screen: Tech company logos]

"AI companies make billions. Founders cash out.
And the societal problems AI could solve? They stay unsolved."

"So I tried an experiment: What if we built a platform
where helping kids wasn't the marketing - it was the architecture?"
```

**The Build (1:00-2:00):**
```
JOSHUA: "I assembled an AI Board of Directors:"

[Screen: AI Board member cards]

"Claude from Anthropic - The Architect
Jules/Gemini from Google - The Integrator
Grok from xAI - The Engineer
Perplexity - The Researcher"

"And I gave them one instruction: Build a for-profit platform
where 60% goes to Verified Pediatric Charities. Make it impossible to change."

[Screen: planned smart contract (backend enforcement active) smart contract deployment]

"They coded it into a smart contract.
Deployed it to Base blockchain.
Contract address: Planned (Q1 2026)"

"No one can modify it. Not me. Not investors. Not even the AI."
```

**The Reality (2:00-3:00):**
```
JOSHUA: "Here's the truth: I make 10% of profits.
That's it. I took a pay cut before we even launched."

[Screen: 60/30/10 split visualization]

"But here's what I got in return:
A company that can't be corrupted.
A mission that can't be diluted.
And goal: help thousands of children with real resources."

"This isn't a charity. We're a for-profit LLC.
But our profit goes where it should - to kids who need it."
```

**The Invitation (3:00-3:30):**
```
JOSHUA: "If you're tired of tech companies that optimize
for shareholder value instead of human value..."

[Screen: aidoesitall.website]

"Come check out what happens when AI builds a company
with different rules."

"aidoesitall.website. Subscribe to AI services.
60% goes to kids. Every time."

[Screen: "FOR THE KIDS" with Core Node logo]

"Built by AI. For the kids. Always."
```

**Production Notes:**

- Show actual code on monitors in background

- Export at maximum quality (under 2MB file size)
- Test readability at small sizes (mobile view)
- Use high contrast (dark background, bright text)
- Avoid text walls (max 6-8 words)
- Include faces when possible (increases CTR by 30%+)
- Use emojis sparingly (only if brand-appropriate)
- A/B test thumbnails using TubeBuddy or VidIQ
- Update thumbnails if CTR drops below 4%

**Thumbnail Creation Workflow:**
1. Design in Figma/Canva with brand colors
2. Export 1280x720px PNG
3. Upload to YouTube Studio
4. Preview on mobile (most views come from mobile)
5. Compare side-by-side with competitor thumbnails
6. Adjust contrast/size if needed

### Post #2: Behind the Code

**Title:** "Code Snippet: How the 60/30/10 Split Works"

**Content:**
```
?? BEHIND THE CODE: The Immutable 60/30/10 Split

Ever wonder how we guarantee 60% to Verified Pediatric Charities?

Here's the actual code from our smart contract (planned smart contract (backend enforcement active)):

```solidity
// Immutable profit allocation - CANNOT be changed
uint256 constant CHARITY_PERCENTAGE = 60;
uint256 constant INFRASTRUCTURE_PERCENTAGE = 30;
uint256 constant FOUNDER_PERCENTAGE = 10;

function allocateProfits(uint256 totalAmount) public {
    uint256 charityShare = (totalAmount * CHARITY_PERCENTAGE) / 100;
    uint256 infraShare = (totalAmount * INFRASTRUCTURE_PERCENTAGE) / 100;
    uint256 founderShare = (totalAmount * FOUNDER_PERCENTAGE) / 100;

    // Allocations are final and recorded on-chain
}
```

These percentages are hardcoded. Not in a config file. Not in a database.
In a deployed smart contract on Base blockchain.

Contract Address: Planned (Q1 2026)

NO ONE can change these numbers. Not the founder. Not investors.
Not even the AI that wrote this code.

That's how you build a mission that can't be corrupted.

### Post #5: FAQ Highlight

**Title:** "Your Questions Answered: FOR THE KIDS FAQ"

**Content:**
```
? FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

You asked. We answered.

Q: "How do I verify the 60% actually goes to charity?"
A: Every transaction includes a BaseScan link. Click it to see your allocation recorded on Base blockchain. Smart Contract: Planned (Q1 2026)

Q: "Can the founder change the 60/30/10 split?"
A: No. It's locked in a deployed smart contract. Immutable means IMMUTABLE.

Q: "Which charities receive the funds?"
A: Verified Pediatric Charities (Partner EIN pending). We're in final negotiations with [charity name]. Updates posted monthly.

Q: "Is this a tax write-off?"
A: No. You're purchasing AI services, not contributing. The 60% is OUR profit allocation, not your contribution.

Q: "Why 60%? Why not 100%?"
A: Because 30% keeps the infrastructure running and 10% keeps the founder alive. Sustainable mission beats unsustainable charity.

Q: "What AI services do you offer?"
A: AI automation tools, ChatGPT wrappers, custom workflows, and enterprise solutions. Full list: aidoesitall.website

Q: "How is this different from corporate charity programs?"
A: Corporate programs are discretionary. Ours is hardcoded. They can change it. We can't.

### 5.2 Templates for Engaging on Relevant Videos

**Target Video Types:**
- AI/ML tutorials and news
- Blockchain/crypto explainer videos
- Startup/entrepreneur content
- Social impact/charity tech videos

- Include link only if directly relevant
- Focus on education, not selling

**Template for AI Tool Videos:**
```
"Great breakdown of [AI tool]! We're using Claude AI to build similar functionality,
but with 60% of revenue allocated to Verified Pediatric Charities via smart contract.
Really interesting to see different approaches to AI integration."
```

**Template for Blockchain Videos:**
```
"Smart contract immutability is underrated for mission-driven projects.
We deployed a profit allocation contract on Base that locks 60% to charity -
no one can change it, not even the founder. That's the power of blockchain."
```

**Template for Startup Journey Videos:**
```
"Love the transparency in this video. We're taking a similar approach with FOR THE KIDS -
showing our entire tech stack, hardware setup, and financial split (60/30/10).
More founders should document the journey like this."
```

**Template for Charity Tech Videos:**
```
"The challenge with traditional charity models is discretion - they can change priorities.
We solved this with an planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing): 60% locked to Verified Pediatric Charities.
Code doesn't change its mind. Interesting to see other approaches in this space."
```

**Template for Tech Review Videos:**
```
"[Agree/disagree with their take]. We're building something similar at FOR THE KIDS,
but open-sourcing parts of it. If you're interested in [specific tech],
check out our GitHub - we've shared the smart contract code there."
```

**DO NOT:**
- Drop links without adding value
- Copy-paste the same comment repeatedly (YouTube detects this)
- Engage on unrelated videos (irrelevant spam hurts SEO)
- Argue with other commenters
- Use all caps or excessive emojis
- Mention competitors negatively

**DO:**
- Answer questions genuinely
- Share technical insights
- Link to BaseScan (it's educational, not promotional)
- Engage in existing conversations
- Upvote other valuable comments
- Use proper grammar and spelling

### 7.5 Quarterly Strategy Review

**Every 3 Months:**

1. **Performance Analysis:**
   - Which video format performs best? (Explainer, Tutorial, Shorts?)
   - Which topics get the most engagement? (Tech stack, Mission, Verification?)
   - What's our audience demographic? (Developers? Entrepreneurs? Charity advocates?)
   - Which traffic source is most valuable? (Search, Browse, Suggested?)

2. **Competitor Analysis:**
   - Who are the top 5 channels in our niche?
   - What's working for them that we're not doing?
   - What gaps exist that we can fill?
   - Are there emerging trends we should jump on?

3. **Content Strategy Pivot:**
   - Double down on what works (if Shorts perform best, make more Shorts)
   - Kill what doesn't (if long-form flops, focus on mid-form)
   - Test new formats (Livestreams? Podcasts? Interviews?)
   - Adjust posting cadence (if daily Shorts work, scale up production)

4. **Monetization Review:**
   - Are we eligible for YouTube Partner Program? (1,000 subs + 4,000 watch hours)
   - Should we enable ads? (Does this align with brand?)
   - Should we create channel memberships? (Exclusive content for supporters)
   - Should we sell courses/digital products through YouTube?

5. **Goal Adjustment:**
   - Did we hit our 3-month goals?
   - What were the blockers?
   - What are realistic goals for next quarter?
   - Do we need to increase production budget/frequency?

## Key Success Factors

1. **Consistency Over Perfection**
   - Publish on schedule, even if video isn't "perfect"
   - Consistency trains the algorithm to recommend your content
   - Viewers value regular uploads over occasional masterpieces

2. **Transparency as Differentiator**
   - Show the smart contract code in every video
   - Include BaseScan links in every description
   - Don't hide the "boring" tech details - that's your moat

3. **Education Over Selling**
   - Teach viewers about blockchain verification
   - Explain smart contracts in simple terms
   - Position as thought leader, not salesperson

4. **Community Engagement**
   - Respond to EVERY comment in first 24 hours
   - Ask questions in community posts
   - Feature customers in content (UGC builds trust)

5. **Data-Driven Iteration**
   - Review analytics weekly
   - Kill what doesn't work (ruthlessly)
   - Double down on what does (aggressively)

6. **Mission-First Messaging**
   - Every video ends with "FOR THE KIDS"
   - Never apologize for the 60/30/10 split
   - Lead with impact stats (goal: help thousands of children)

7. **Technical Credibility**
   - Show real code, not stock footage
   - Display actual hardware, not renders
   - Use proper terminology (smart contract, not "blockchain contribution system")

8. **Long-Term Thinking**
   - YouTube rewards channels that stick around
   - First 100 videos are practice - don't judge too harshly
   - Subscriber growth compounds over time
