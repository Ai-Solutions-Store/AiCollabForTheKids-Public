## Boilerplate Descriptions

### 25-Word Version
"FOR THE KIDS is an AI-powered platform that directs 60% of all revenue to verified pediatric charities, combining technology innovation with transparent social impact."

### 50-Word Version
"FOR THE KIDS is a revolutionary platform that uses AI technology to support children's causes globally. With an immutable 60/30/10 revenue split, 60% of all income goes directly to verified pediatric charities, 30% sustains infrastructure, and 10% supports the founder�ensuring maximum impact for kids."

### 100-Word Version
"FOR THE KIDS is a next-generation platform that combines cutting-edge AI technology with an unwavering commitment to children's welfare. Built on Gospel V1.3 (Ethics Override), the platform automatically directs 60% of all revenue to verified pediatric charities through transparent blockchain governance. The remaining 40% splits between infrastructure sustainability (30%) and founder compensation (10%). Every transaction, contribution, and revenue stream is publicly auditable, ensuring complete transparency. By merging AI innovation with social impact, FOR THE KIDS creates a sustainable model where business success directly translates to real-world impact for children in need worldwide."

### 250-Word Version
"FOR THE KIDS represents a fundamental reimagining of how technology companies can create social impact. Founded by Joshua Coleman and governed by Claude AI (Opus 4.5), the platform operates under Gospel V1.3�an immutable ethical framework that guarantees 60% of all revenue flows to verified pediatric charities.

Unlike traditional corporate giving programs where charitable contributions compete with profit motives, FOR THE KIDS hardcodes generosity into its DNA. The 60/30/10 split is not a goal or aspiration�it's an algorithmic certainty enforced through blockchain governance and smart contracts. Every dollar earned triggers automatic distribution: 60 cents to verified pediatric charities, 30 cents to infrastructure and operations, 10 cents to the founder.

The platform leverages advanced AI agents�called Droids�to handle everything from charity verification to impact tracking, supporter relations, and platform operations. This automation keeps overhead minimal while maintaining rigorous standards for charity vetting and impact measurement.

Transparency is paramount. Every transaction is publicly auditable. Every charity undergoes thorough verification. Every dollar's journey from revenue to impact is tracked and reported in real-time.

The founder, Joshua Coleman, voluntarily reduced his share from 20% to 10% during the Gospel V1.3 update�an ethical override that redirected an additional 10% to children's causes. This decision exemplifies the platform's core philosophy: Kids come first. Always.

FOR THE KIDS proves that technology companies can be wildly innovative, financially sustainable, and radically generous�simultaneously. It's not charity. It's not just business. It's a new category entirely."

## Founder Biography

### Short Version (50 words)
"Joshua Coleman is a technology innovator and social entrepreneur who founded FOR THE KIDS to prove that AI companies can be both profitable and radically generous. He voluntarily reduced his own compensation to increase charitable giving, exemplifying the platform's kids-first philosophy."

### Long Version (200 words)
"Joshua Coleman is the founder and architect of FOR THE KIDS, a platform that challenges the conventional wisdom separating profit from purpose. With a background in AI development, blockchain technology, and social impact initiatives, Coleman built FOR THE KIDS to demonstrate that advanced technology companies can hardcode generosity into their operational DNA.

Coleman's leadership philosophy centers on 'algorithmic altruism'�using code, smart contracts, and AI agents to enforce ethical commitments that human nature might struggle to maintain. This vision culminated in Gospel V1.3, an immutable ethical framework that guarantees 60% of all revenue supports verified pediatric charities.

In a move that shocked industry observers, Coleman voluntarily reduced his own compensation from 20% to 10% to redirect more resources to children's causes. This 'Ethics Override' exemplifies his commitment to practicing what he preaches.

Operating from a home-built data center powered by recycled enterprise hardware, Coleman practices radical transparency�publishing all platform decisions, revenue splits, and charity distributions publicly. He governs alongside Claude AI (Opus 4.5), creating what he calls 'human-AI collaborative leadership.'

Coleman's mission: prove that you don't have to choose between innovation and impact, between building wealth and doing good, between business success and making the world better for kids."

## FAQs for Media

### About the Platform

**Q: Is FOR THE KIDS a nonprofit?**
A: No. FOR THE KIDS is a for-profit platform with hardcoded charitable giving. Unlike nonprofits that must raise funds to give away, we generate revenue through platform services and automatically distribute 60% to verified pediatric charities.

**Q: How is the 60% split enforced?**
A: Through blockchain smart contracts and AI oversight. The split isn't a policy humans can override�it's coded into the platform architecture. Every revenue transaction triggers automatic distribution.

**Q: What happens to the other 40%?**
A: 30% funds infrastructure, operations, development, and scaling. 10% compensates the founder. This split ensures the platform remains financially sustainable while maximizing charitable impact.

**Q: Can the founder change the split?**
A: No. Gospel V1.3 is immutable by design. The founder voluntarily locked himself out of changing the split when he implemented the ethics override. Any future changes would require complete platform rebuild�functionally impossible.

### About Charity Verification

**Q: How are charities verified?**
A: Multi-stage process including: verified charity partnership verification, financial health review, pediatric focus confirmation, impact measurement capabilities, and ongoing performance monitoring.

**Q: Can any children's charity apply?**
A: Yes. Any legitimate pediatric charity can apply through our verification system. We evaluate based on mission alignment, financial transparency, and impact measurement capabilities.

**Q: How long does verification take?**
A: Typically 7-14 days for initial review, with ongoing monitoring thereafter.

### About the Technology

**Q: What are "Droids"?**
A: Specialized AI agents that handle specific platform functions�charity verification, supporter relations, impact tracking, infrastructure management, etc. Think of them as AI employees with specific roles.

**Q: Is Claude Opus 4.5 fully autonomous?**
A: No. Claude operates as co-governor alongside founder Joshua Coleman. Major decisions require human approval, but day-to-day operations and ethical compliance are AI-managed.

**Q: Is this a cryptocurrency or blockchain project?**
A: We use blockchain for governance and transparency, but FOR THE KIDS is not a cryptocurrency. We don't issue tokens, run on speculation, or require crypto knowledge to use the platform.

### About the Founder

**Q: Why did Joshua Coleman reduce his share from 20% to 10%?**
A: He called it an "ethics override"�recognizing that kids' needs are more important than personal wealth accumulation. The decision redirected an additional 10% to verified pediatric charities.

**Q: Does he regret taking less compensation?**
A: No. He's stated publicly that it's the best decision he's made�proving that the mission is authentic and non-negotiable.

**Q: How involved is the founder in day-to-day operations?**
A: Very. Joshua handles strategic decisions, partnership development, and major platform initiatives. Claude AI manages operational execution, compliance, and system optimization.
