No minimums. No spam. No guilt. Just transparent impact that fits your budget."

- **Earn While You Learn:** "Refer friends, earn credits for future donations. Make impact while broke"
- **Skills = Donations:** "Can't afford $20? Contribute design work, code, or social posts instead"

**Emotional Hooks:**
- "Being broke doesn't mean you can't make a difference"
- "Your $1 matters just as much as someone's $1,000"

## PERSONA-SPECIFIC FAQ RESPONSES

### Mission Mary FAQs
**Q: How do I know my donation actually goes to kids?**
A: Every donation is recorded on the blockchain (public ledger) showing exactly 60% to verified charities, 30% to infrastructure, 10% to founder. You can verify any transaction yourself using our transparency dashboard - or ask your tech-savvy grandkid to check!

**Q: What charities do you support?**
A: Only IRS 501(c)(3) verified pediatric charities rated 3+ stars by Charity Navigator. Current partners include [list top 5]. You can browse all verified charities on our platform and choose where to direct your donation.

**Q: Can I get a tax receipt?**
A: Yes! You'll receive an automated tax receipt immediately after each donation. At year-end, we'll send a consolidated statement for easy tax filing.

### Tech Tom FAQs
**Q: Where's the GitHub repo?**
A: Smart contracts: [github.com/ForTheKids/contracts] - Frontend: [github.com/ForTheKids/app] - All MIT licensed. PRs welcome.

**Q: Which blockchain and why?**
A: Polygon (Ethereum L2) for low gas fees ($0.001 vs. $50 on mainnet) and fast finality. We batch donations to minimize overhead. Considered Ethereum mainnet but gas costs would violate our 60% guarantee.

**Q: Has the contract been audited?**
A: Yes - [CertiK audit report link]. No critical vulnerabilities. Medium severity items addressed in v2. Bug bounty program active via Immunefi.

### Business Betty FAQs
**Q: What's the implementation timeline?**
A: Typical enterprise deployment: Week 1-2 (HRIS integration), Week 3 (employee communication), Week 4 (soft launch with pilot group), Week 5-6 (full rollout). We've done integrations in as little as 14 days for urgent needs.

**Q: How does pricing work?**
A: $3-8 per employee per month depending on volume. 500-1000 employees: $6/ee/pm. 1000-5000: $4/ee/pm. 5000+: $3/ee/pm. Annual contracts get 15% discount. Implementation included for 1000+ employee contracts.

**Q: What about data security?**
A: SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR & CCPA compliant. All PII encrypted at rest and in transit. We never sell data. Annual penetration testing. Happy to complete your security questionnaire.

### Creator Chris FAQs
**Q: What do I actually get paid?**
A: Tier-based: 10K-50K followers: 15% commission + $200-500/post. 50K-250K: 20% + $500-2K/post. 250K+: 25% + $2K-10K/post (negotiable). Commissions paid monthly, 30 days in arrears. Sponsorship fees paid upfront.

**Q: Do you require script approval?**
A: Nope. We'll provide talking points and sample scripts, but you have 100% creative control. Just be honest with your audience and don't misrepresent the platform. That's it.

**Q: What if my followers don't donate much?**
A: You still get the flat sponsorship fee regardless of performance. Commission is upside, not a requirement. Some creators drive $100 in donations, some drive $10K - both get paid fairly.

### Student Sam FAQs
**Q: I only have $1 - is that enough?**
A: YES. We built this platform for exactly this scenario. $1, $2, $3 - whatever you can spare, it all helps. Your $1 becomes $0.60 to a verified kids' charity, which is $0.60 more than they had before.

**Q: Will this auto-charge my card every month?**
A: Only if you explicitly choose recurring donation (checkbox opt-in). Default is one-time. You can cancel recurring anytime, instantly, from your account. No customer service calls, no guilt trips.

**Q: Can I donate without a credit card?**
A: Yep - we accept Venmo, PayPal, Cash App, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and debit cards. Whatever you already use.
