Subject: Product Hunt Hunter Request - AI Platform with 60% Immutable Charity Split

Hi Chris,

I'm Joshua Coleman, founder of FOR THE KIDS. I've built something unusual that I think fits your worldview perfectly:

An AI ecosystem that mathematically allocates 60% of all profits to verified pediatric charities through blockchain smart contracts. Not promises�code.

You've spent your career advocating for how technology can serve humanity. This is that�hardcoded generosity.

Key Details:
� 60% to pediatric charities (smart contract enforced)
� Multi-AI governance (Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok collaborate)
� building towards impact+ annual revenue projection across 4 platforms
� 100% transparent (every transaction on-chain)
� Open-source code (GitHub: Ai-Solutions-Store)
� Gospel: 14 immutable rules protecting the mission

This isn't a charity campaign�it's a for-profit AI platform where profit and purpose are mathematically inseparable.

I'm planning a Product Hunt launch in [MONTH] and would be honored if you'd consider hunting it. The tech community deserves to see what happens when you prove charity through code instead of promising it through marketing.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to discuss?

Best regards,
Joshua Coleman
Founder, FOR THE KIDS

P.S. � The smart contract is immutable. The founder took 10% so kids get 60%. That's the opposite of unicorn incentives.

Subject: Product Hunt Hunter Request - For-Profit AI Platform with On-Chain Profit Transparency

Hi Hiten,

I'm Joshua Coleman, founder of FOR THE KIDS. I'm building something I think would interest you�it's at the intersection of SaaS transparency and smart contract automation.

The Platform:
An AI ecosystem where 60% of profits automatically flow to pediatric charities via smart contracts. Four AIs govern it. The split is immutable. Every transaction is on-chain and auditable.

Why This Matters (Analytics Perspective):
- Live Jules Dashboard showing real-time revenue split
- 100% transaction transparency (BaseScan audit trail)
- No "accounting gimmicks"�it's mathematical
- Case study in how incentive structures drive behavior

Current Metrics:
� goal: help thousands of children
� 60/30/10 split enforced automatically
� Smart contract immutability = founder can't override it
� Open-source codebase (fully auditable)

I'm launching on Product Hunt in [MONTH] and would love your insight as a hunter. You understand business transparency better than anyone in the PH community.

15-minute call?

Best,
Joshua Coleman

P.S. � The 10% founder split isn't sustainable generosity porn. It's a real business model. Want to talk through the unit economics?

Subject: Product Hunt Hunter Request - Multi-AI Platform with Smart Contract Charity

Hi Bram,

I'm Joshua Coleman, founder of FOR THE KIDS. I've been impressed by your consistent presence on Product Hunt�you hunt daily and genuinely engage with makers. That's rare.

I'm building something at the intersection of AI and blockchain that I think your community would love:

**FOR THE KIDS:** An AI platform where four AIs (Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok) collaborate to govern a business that automatically allocates 60% of profits to pediatric charities via smart contracts.

What Makes It Interesting:
� Multi-AI governance (no single AI controls it)
� Smart contract immutability (no human can override)
� Real-time transparency dashboard (Jules)
� thousands of children� Open-source code (GitHub: Ai-Solutions-Store)

This combines the transparency potential of blockchain + the collaborative intelligence of multi-AI systems + authentic social impact. It's a story about how technology can reshape incentive structures.

I'm launching on Product Hunt in [MONTH] and would be honored to have you hunt it. Your audience strikes the perfect balance�they care about innovation AND impact.

Hi [Hunter],

Thank you so much for considering this. I completely understand if the timing doesn't work.

If you have any hunter friends who might align with this mission, I'd appreciate a referral. And I'll definitely keep you in the loop on future launches.

Thanks for everything you do for the community.

Best,
Joshua
```
