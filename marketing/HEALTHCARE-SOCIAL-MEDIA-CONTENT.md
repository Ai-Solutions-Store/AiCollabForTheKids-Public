## SECTION 3: LINKEDIN CONTENT

### LinkedIn Post 1: Professional Thought Leadership

**Format:** Long-form professional post (1,200+ characters)

**Content:**

"The Problem With Healthcare Technology (And Why FOR THE KIDS Is Different)

I've worked in healthcare for [X years]. I've watched technology companies promise to improve patient care, streamline workflows, and revolutionize healthcare delivery.

What they don't talk about: WHERE THE PROFITS GO.

Most healthcare software:
- 60% → Shareholders
- 30% → Executive compensation
- 20% → Actually advancing healthcare mission

That disconnect bothered me. So I joined FOR THE KIDS.

Here's what's different:

**Gospel V1.3: Immutable Profit Allocation**
- 60% → Verified Pediatric Charities & Children's Hospitals
- 30% → Infrastructure & operations
- 10% → Founder sustainability

Not a suggestion. Not changeable. Immutable code.

**Why This Matters:**

Healthcare professionals don't invest in technology because we want to enrich shareholders. We invest because we believe it makes us better at our mission: caring for patients.

FOR THE KIDS aligns that investment with that mission.

Every dollar I spend supports the pediatric hospitals where my colleagues work.

**The Broader Implication:**

What if ALL healthcare technology operated this way?

What if every healthcare professional who invested in technology knew exactly where those profits went?

What if mission alignment wasn't a nice-to-have, but a requirement?

**My Challenge to Healthcare Technology Leaders:**

Why shouldn't pediatric charities receive 60% of healthcare tech revenue?

What's the argument for keeping it with shareholders?

I'd love to hear your thoughts.

### LinkedIn Post 2: Industry Commentary

**Format:** Short-form professional post (500+ characters)

**Content:**

"Healthcare professionals spend their careers asking: 'How do I deliver better care to patients?'

It's time we asked: 'How does my technology investment impact my mission?'

FOR THE KIDS answers that question with one number: 60% → pediatric hospitals.

Not 30%. Not 15%. 60%.

Mission-aligned technology is possible. It just requires companies willing to prioritize healthcare professionals and patients over shareholder returns.

If you're in healthcare, your tools should reflect your values.

### LinkedIn Post 4: Employee Advocacy Post

**Format:** Short-form post

**Content:**

"Proud to work for FOR THE KIDS.

Every day, we talk to healthcare professionals who are exhausted by healthcare technology that doesn't align with their mission.

They spend their careers caring for patients. They pay for tools that support those patients. But the profits often go anywhere BUT back to patient care.

That's backwards.

Gospel V1.3: 60% → pediatric charities. 30% → infrastructure. 10% → founder.

Not changeable. Immutable.

Healthcare professionals deserve tools that reflect their values.

## SECTION 4: TWITTER/X CONTENT

### Twitter Thread 1: The Mission (7 Tweets)

**Tweet 1:**
"Thread: Why healthcare tech should prioritize pediatric hospitals

I'm a healthcare professional. I care for patients. I use technology to do it better.

Here's the problem: The technology companies I pay for? They prioritize shareholders over the hospitals I work in."

**Tweet 2:**
"Most healthcare software allocation:
- 60% → Shareholders
- 30% → Executive compensation
- 20% → Actual healthcare mission

That's backwards. 🔄"

**Tweet 3:**
"FOR THE KIDS proposes a different model:

Gospel V1.3 - Immutable allocation:
- 60% → Pediatric Charities & Hospitals
- 30% → Infrastructure
- 10% → Founder

Not a suggestion. Code-enforced. Permanent."

**Tweet 4:**
"The impact: If 100,000 healthcare professionals subscribed

$12M+ annual revenue
$7.2M → Pediatric hospitals
That's resources for treatments, programs, research

Healthcare professionals' technology investment actually supports their mission."

**Tweet 5:**
"Why pediatric hospitals specifically?

Because healthcare professionals disproportionately care for children. Nurses, pharmacists, pediatricians - they work in environments where child health is central.

Let that investment matter. ❤️"

**Tweet 6:**
"The broader implication: What if ALL healthcare tech worked this way?

What if profit allocation to mission was a REQUIREMENT, not optional?

What if doctors, nurses, pharmacists could invest in technology guilt-free?"

**Tweet 7:**
"That's the FOR THE KIDS mission.

It's possible. It just requires companies willing to prioritize healthcare professionals + patients over shareholder returns.

Healthcare workers: Your tools should reflect your values.

Meet Sarah, a pediatric nurse at [Children's Hospital]. Sarah has been using FOR THE KIDS for 3 months.

Here's what she told us:

'I've worked in healthcare for 10 years. I've watched technology companies come and go. Most of them promise amazing things, but when you look at their profit allocation, you realize they don't actually care about patient health. They care about shareholder returns.

FOR THE KIDS is different. 60% of my subscription goes directly to the pediatric hospitals I work with. When I use the platform, I KNOW that investment supports the children I care for.

That alignment matters. It validates my mission. It reminds me why I chose healthcare.'

✓ $360 subscription cost
✓ $216 directed to pediatric charities (60%)
