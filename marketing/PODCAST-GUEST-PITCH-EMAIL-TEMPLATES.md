## UNIVERSAL TEMPLATE (USE THIS FOR MOST PODCASTS)

### Subject Line Formula
```
[Unique Angle] - Guest Pitch for [Podcast Name]
```

### Email Body

```
Hi [Host Name/Producer Name],

I'm reaching out about a guest opportunity that could resonate with your
[Podcast Name] audience.

I'm Joshua Coleman, founder of AIDoesItAll.Website�an AI platform with
a unique structure: 60% of all revenue is automatically allocated to
Verified Pediatric Charities via DAO-enforced smart contracts.

Here's what makes this different from typical startup stories:

1. NOT A PROMISE
   Smart contracts on Base blockchain enforce the 60/30/10 split
   automatically. No human can override it. No board can vote to change it.

2. AI GOVERNANCE
   Our "AI Board of Directors" includes Claude (Anthropic), Jules/Gemini
   (Google), and Grok (xAI). They make operational decisions. Claude
   writes 100% of production code.

3. FOUNDER SACRIFICE
   I reduced my share from 20% to 10% so kids could get 60% instead of 50%.
   This is Gospel V1.3�Ethics Override.

Current impact: $thousands allocated to children's hospitals.

I think your [Podcast Name] audience would appreciate:
- [TALKING POINT 1 - relevant to their niche]
- [TALKING POINT 2 - relevant to their niche]
- [TALKING POINT 3 - relevant to their niche]

This isn't typical "corporate social responsibility"�it's a business model
where charity and profit are mathematically inseparable.

Available for [30/45/60]-minute interview, remote (Zoom/Riverside/SquadCast).

Happy to discuss:
- How DAO governance prevents mission drift
- Why blockchain beats traditional nonprofit models
- The future of Transparent philanthropy
- [CUSTOM TOPIC for their audience]

FOR THE KIDS,
Joshua Coleman

## SPECIALIZED TEMPLATES BY CATEGORY

### TEMPLATE A: TECH/AI PODCASTS

**Subject:** AI Governance Model with Claude/Gemini/Grok as Board Members

```
Hi [Host Name],

What if AI companies were governed BY AI?

At AIDoesItAll.Website, our "AI Board of Directors" includes:
- Claude (Anthropic) - The Architect
- Jules/Gemini (Google) - The Integrator
- Grok (xAI) - The Engineer
- Perplexity - The Researcher
- Human founder - The Executive

This isn't philosophical�it's operational. Claude writes our code. Jules
monitors compliance. Grok manages infrastructure. All changes require AI
consensus before deployment.

The result? A platform that:
- contributes 60% to Verified Pediatric Charities (DAO-enforced)
- Never deviates from mission (AI prevents drift)
- Scales without traditional management overhead
- Runs 184GB bare metal cluster (T5500 + 9020 + Sabertooth)

Your [Podcast Name] audience would appreciate the "federated governance"
model�it's how we prevent the usual startup mission creep.

Open to discussing:
- How AI board members divide responsibilities
- Why this prevents mission drift better than human boards
- The future of AI-governed organizations
- Technical architecture: Multi-model orchestration in production

Available for 45-60 minute deep-dive interview.

Best,
Joshua Coleman
Founder, AIDoesItAll.Website

### TEMPLATE B: CHARITY/NONPROFIT PODCASTS

**Subject:** The Tech Revolution in Charitable Giving�Smart Contracts Guarantee Transparency

```
Hi [Host Name],

Your [Podcast Name] audience struggles with one core issue: supporter trust
and transparency in charitable giving.

I built a solution: a technology platform where trust isn't a promise�
it's encoded in blockchain.

Here's the mechanism:

Traditional Charity Model:
- "We promise to allocate X% to kids"
- Hopeful. Human-dependent. Changeable.

FOR THE KIDS Model:
- Smart contract on Base blockchain ENFORCES 60% allocation
- No human can override it. No board can vote to reduce it.
- Live dashboard shows real-time allocation (immutable)
- $thousands verified on blockchain today

This is the future of philanthropy: Trust Code, Not Humans.

Your audience needs to understand:
- How DAO governance prevents corporate mission drift forever
- Why blockchain beats traditional nonprofit models
- Live case study: Real-time charity allocations on dashboard
- Why founder chose 60/30/10 split over 60/30/10

The Gospel V1.3 story: I took LESS (10% vs. 20%) so kids could get MORE
(60% vs. 60%).

Open to discussing:
- Detailed breakdown of smart contract mechanics
- Comparison: Traditional nonprofits vs. DAO models
- Why for-profit LLCs can outperform 501(c)(3)s
- The future of Transparent philanthropy

Available for 45-60 minute interview.

Best,
Joshua Coleman
Founder, AIDoesItAll.Website
https://aidoesitall.website
```

### TEMPLATE C: ENTREPRENEURSHIP PODCASTS

**Subject:** The Anti-Exit Startup�Built to Run Forever

```
Hi [Host Name],

Most founders optimize for exit (IPO, acquisition, buyout).

I optimized for immortality.

At AIDoesItAll.Website, I designed a business that:
- Can NEVER be acquired (DAO governance prevents it)
- Can NEVER go public (mission lock prevents it)
- Can NEVER stop contributing (backend systems enforce it)
- Runs for 100+ years without founder involvement

Why? Because I believe some missions are too important to let humans
compromise them.

The business still generates profit:
- 60% ? Verified Pediatric Charities (Gospel V1.3)
- 30% ? Infrastructure (servers, team, operations)
- 10% ? Founder (me)

I took LESS (reduced from 20% to 10%) so kids get MORE.

Your [Podcast Name] audience appreciates unconventional thinking:
- How to build a business that outlives you
- Why code governance beats human boards
- The moment I chose immortality over exit
- Systems thinking in business structure
- The 60-year marketing plan (code, not campaigns)

This isn't a startup in the traditional sense. It's a permanence protocol.

Available for 45-60 minute deep conversation about:
- Systems design for immortal organizations
- Mission lock via smart contracts
- Alternative exits (immortality vs. acquisition/IPO)
- Why traditional VCs hate this model (but users love it)

Best,
Joshua Coleman
Founder, AIDoesItAll.Website
https://aidoesitall.website

### TEMPLATE D: PARENTING PODCASTS

**Subject:** Story Idea - Tech Dad Builds AI Platform to Fund Kids' Hospitals

```
Hi [Host Name],

I'm a dad who got fed up with "thoughts and prayers" philanthropy.

So I built an AI platform where 60% of every dollar AUTOMATICALLY goes to
Verified Pediatric Charities. No pledges. No galas. No contribution fatigue.
Just code that enforces the mission forever.

The kicker? I reduced my own share from 20% to 10% so kids could get more.

My kids know their dad chose to help other kids over making more money.

That's not a business story�that's a parenting story about values.

Your [Podcast Name] audience would appreciate:
- Why I picked children's hospitals specifically (personal story)
- How I explain "DAO governance" and "smart contracts" to my kids
- The moment I decided kids deserved 60%, not 60%
- Teaching children that values matter more than money
- Proof through action (not just words): Code enforces the mission

This is about raising kids who see that ethics can be built into systems,
not just preached from pulpits.

Available for 30-45 minute interview. Happy to discuss:
- Parenting story angle
- How to teach kids about business ethics
- Why transparency matters
- The Gospel V1.3 story (founder sacrifice)

Best,
Joshua Coleman
Dad, Founder - AIDoesItAll.Website
https://aidoesitall.website

### TEMPLATE E: HEALTHCARE PODCASTS

**Subject:** AI Platform Funding Pediatric Hospital Innovation

```
Hi [Host Name],

Hospitals struggle to fund innovation. What if tech companies automatically
allocated profits to medical care?

AIDoesItAll.Website generates revenue through AI services. Then:
- 60% goes to Verified Pediatric Charities (smart contract enforced)
- Hospitals receive funding for equipment, staff, R&D
- Blockchain provides full transparency to supporters

Current impact: $thousands allocated to children's hospitals.

Your [Podcast Name] audience would appreciate:
- The DAO governance model (prevents mission drift)
- How smart contracts verify charity allocations
- Why this scales better than grant applications
- The intersection of AI, blockchain, and healthcare funding
- Real examples: Which hospitals benefit, how much per hospital

This isn't a contribution model. It's built into the revenue structure.

Available for 45-60 minute interview discussing:
- Tech revenue streams as pediatric care funding
- Blockchain verification of charitable allocations
- Partnership models between tech companies and hospitals
- Why hospitals should demand this model from tech partners
- Future of tech-enabled healthcare funding

Best,
Joshua Coleman
Founder, AIDoesItAll.Website
https://aidoesitall.website
```

### TEMPLATE F: SOCIAL IMPACT PODCASTS

**Subject:** Moving Beyond 'Pledge Culture'�How Code Enforces Charity Commitments

```
Hi [Host Name],

"Pledge culture" is broken. Companies promise to allocate, then:
- Reduce contributions when revenue dips
- Vote to lower percentages at board meetings
- Get acquired and the charity promise disappears
- Face no consequences for broken promises

I encoded the promise into a smart contract.

At AIDoesItAll.Website:
- No human can override the 60% allocation
- No board can vote to reduce it
- Acquisition/IPO is structurally impossible
- Blockchain proves it happens automatically
- Code runs forever

Your [Podcast Name] audience cares about systemic change. This IS systemic.

This eliminates the #1 trust issue in corporate giving:

"Will they actually do it?"

Answer: Code proves it. Every transaction visible on blockchain.

Open to discussing:
- How DAO governance prevents corporate mission drift
- The rise of "smart contract philanthropy"
- Why blockchain is the future of trust
- How code can guarantee commitments
- Case study: Why FOR THE KIDS works where pledges fail

Available for 45-60 minute interview.

Best,
Joshua Coleman
Founder, AIDoesItAll.Website
https://aidoesitall.website

## PITCH VARIATIONS BY SHOW SIZE

### FOR MEGA-SHOWS (10M+ listeners like How I Built This, Tim Ferriss)

**Subject:** The Origin Story Nobody's Ever Heard - The AI Platform That Governs Itself

```
Hi [Host Name],

I have a story you've never heard before.

I didn't build a company. I built something that builds itself.

After failing with traditional businesses for years, I made a radical decision:
Let AI run the company. Not "assist"�RUN it.

Today:
- Claude (Anthropic) writes ALL production code
- Jules/Gemini (Google) validates business logic
- Grok (xAI) manages infrastructure
- backend systems enforce 60% charity allocation
- Platform operates 24/7 without me

The wildest part? I reduced my personal share from 20% to 10% because Claude
calculated kids should get more.

$thousands allocated to children's hospitals. Zero mission drift. Zero CEO drama.

This is the most unconventional origin story in tech�because companies like
this don't exist yet.

Your audience has never heard this story before.

Available for 60-90 minute deep-dive. Happy to discuss:
- The moment I decided to let AI govern
- How the "AI Board of Directors" makes decisions
- Why I trust code more than humans
- The Gospel V1.3 story (founder takes less)
- Systems thinking in post-human organizations
- Why this works (when traditional companies fail)

Best,
Joshua Coleman
Founder, AIDoesItAll.Website

### FOR MID-SIZE SHOWS (50K-500K listeners)

**Subject:** The Business Model Where 60% Goes to Kids�And Why It Works

```
Hi [Host Name],

Quick story: I built a business where 60% of revenue automatically funds
kids' hospitals. No contribution ask. No guilt. Just purchase = impact.

But here's the twist: Smart contracts on blockchain enforce this. No human
can change it. No board can override it.

This solves the #1 problem with charitable giving: "Will they actually do it?"

Answer: Code proves it.

Your [Podcast Name] audience appreciates:
- Unique business models
- Authentic mission-driven founders
- Practical examples of values in action

Available for 45-minute interview discussing:
- How the 60/30/10 split works
- Why founder took less (Gospel V1.3)
- Impact metrics (kids helped, hospitals served)
- Why this works better than traditional charity

Joshua Coleman

```
Hi [Host Name],

Love your show on [specific topic]. I think your audience would dig this.

I'm building AIDoesItAll.Website�an AI platform where 60% of revenue goes
to kids' hospitals automatically via blockchain.

Nothing crazy technical. Simple story: I wanted to prove business and charity
don't have to be separate.

60% ? Kids' hospitals
30% ? Infrastructure
10% ? Me

I took less (was 20%) so kids get more. Gospel V1.3�ethics override.

$396K+ to hospitals so far.
