### Example Testimonial (Christian)

```
"I'm Sarah, a Christian from a small church in North Carolina. My nephew
faced leukemia last year, and while treatment saved his life, the financial
burden nearly destroyed my brother's family. I saw firsthand how many
families struggle to afford pediatric care.

I discovered FOR THE KIDS through a friend at church who told me about
their guarantee: 60% of every contribution goes directly to verified pediatric
charities. No overhead games. Just 60%.

As a Christian, Jesus taught us that caring for children is non-negotiable.
'Let the little children come to me,' He said. FOR THE KIDS takes that
seriously. It's not just charity. It's Gospel in action.

Our church has hosted two fundraisers, raising $6,000 for FOR THE KIDS.
I've seen our community unite around something meaningful. I've seen young
people grasp that faith means action.

If you're like me—you care about children's health and want your giving
to matter—I'm asking you to support FOR THE KIDS. Your 60 cents of every
dollar reaches a child in crisis. That's faith in action."

### When Criticized for Not Doing Enough

**Template Response:**

```
We appreciate the critique and take it seriously. [Criticism], and [person]
is right that [specific concern].

FOR THE KIDS focuses specifically on pediatric healthcare through verified
charities. We do this one thing well. But we acknowledge that pediatric
health alone doesn't solve poverty, inequality, or systemic injustice.

We're [action taken to address concern], and we invite others working on
[broader issue] to partner with us.

Our 60% commitment to verified pediatric charities stands. We think it's
important work. We're not claiming it's the only work that matters.

We'd like to hear more about your concern. [Contact info for feedback].
