```
Hi [Professor Name],

I'm reaching out because your course on [specific class: "Social Enterprise," "Business Ethics," "Impact Investing"] is exactly where FOR THE KIDS should be discussed.

THE IDEA:

What if your students studied a real company designed around social impact? Not a case study from a textbook - a live platform where students could:
- Analyze our business model (60/30/10 Gospel V1.3)
- Examine our impact measurement framework
- Propose improvements to our social mission
- See their recommendations implemented in real-time

THE OPPORTUNITY:

1. **Guest Lecture** (60-90 min)
   - Present FOR THE KIDS case study
   - Q&A with students
   - Live demo of impact dashboard
   - Discussion: "Can a for-profit company be truly mission-driven?"
   - Virtual or in-person

2. **Class Project**
   - Students audit our financial model
   - Propose impact measurement improvements
   - Design ambassador recruitment campaigns
   - Create marketing materials
   - Best projects get implemented + featured

3. **Student Internships** (optional)
   - Paid internship with FOR THE KIDS
   - 10-20 hours/week during semester

   - Case study materials + teaching guide
   - Student discussion prompts
   - Assignment ideas (essays, audits, etc.)

WHY YOUR STUDENTS WILL ENGAGE:

This is a real company with:
- Transparent financials (quarterly audits published)
- Smart contract enforcement (blockchain verification)
- Measurable social impact (children helped tracking)
- Startup energy (still early, shaped by student input)
- Career opportunity (internships + job offers)

WHY YOU SHOULD DO THIS:

- Authentic case study (better than Harvard Business School cases)
- Student engagement increases (real company vs. case study)
- Business school credibility boost (university mentioned in press)
- Potential guest lecture on other campuses
- Curriculum materials become shareable asset

SAMPLES:

I can provide:
- Full financial transparency (audited statements)
- Smart contract code + blockchain records
- Student testimonials from other universities
- Past class project examples
- Guest lecture slides + materials

NEXT STEPS:

Could we schedule 20 minutes to discuss? This could work for your [Fall/Spring/Summer] course.

Available times:

Looking forward to partnering with you.

Best,
[Your Name]
FOR THE KIDS Academic Partnerships
joshlcoleman@gmail.com

P.S. - Even if guest lecture isn't feasible, I'd be happy to provide materials for your students to analyze. The FOR THE KIDS case is teaching-friendly and raises great discussion questions about business model design, transparency, and impact measurement.

## PART 2: PHONE CALL SCRIPTS

### SCRIPT 1: Discovery Call (20 minutes)
**Goal:** Understand professor's priorities + determine best partnership fit

```
OPENING (1 min):
"Hi [Name], thanks so much for taking time to chat. I'll be brief since I know you're busy.
Quick context: I'm reaching out because [specific reason: your course on X, your research
on Y, your role in Z]. FOR THE KIDS has an opportunity that I think could be valuable for
your students/research."

CONTEXT (2 min):
"FOR THE KIDS is an AI platform where 60% of revenue goes directly to pediatric charities -
it's hardcoded in smart contracts so it can't be changed. We're building partnerships with
universities because we believe students should learn about technology AND see direct social
impact."

SET EXPECTATIONS (1 min):
"I want to respect your time, so this is really just me understanding:
  1. What your priorities are for your students/research
  2. If FOR THE KIDS could be useful
  3. What might interest you"

DISCOVERY QUESTIONS (12 min):
Ask in conversational order, listen more than talk:

[For CS/Faculty]:
1. "What are your priorities for your [course/research/students] this year?"
2. "How do you currently approach [teaching social impact / measuring outcomes / building real-world projects]?"
3. "What's been working well? What's been challenging?"
4. "How do your students engage with [mission-driven work / social impact / real companies]?"
5. "Is there anything you've wanted to do but haven't found the right tool/partner?"

[For Entrepreneurship]:
1. "What are you looking for in hackathon sponsors this year?"
2. "How important is social impact to your student community?"
3. "What would make a sponsor stand out?"
4. "Have you had partnerships with mission-driven companies before?"

[For Research]:
1. "What's the focus of your research group right now?"
2. "How do you identify research projects for grad students?"
3. "What kind of real-world data access would be valuable?"
4. "Are you interested in applications of [blockchain / AI ethics / impact measurement]?"

POSITIONING (3 min):
"Based on what you're saying, I think FOR THE KIDS could help with [specific pain point they mentioned].
Here's why:"

[Option A - Research]:
"We have access to real platform data - [X] users, [Y] transactions, [Z] impact metrics. If
you're interested in [their research area], you could have graduate students work with actual
data from a mission-driven company. Plus, your improvements would directly impact [X] kids."

[Option B - Teaching]:
"We can offer guest lectures, class projects, or student internships. Your students could analyze
a real company that's designed around social impact, not just case studies. And if they want to
get involved, they can actually earn stipends while promoting the platform."

[Option C - Hackathon]:
"We sponsor hackathons with a social impact track. We're looking for partners who care about
not just technical excellence, but using technology to help people. Sounds like [University]
has that culture."

GAUGE INTEREST (1 min):
"Does any of that sound interesting? Or is there something different that would be more useful?"

NEXT STEPS (1 min):
If interested: "Great! Let me send you some materials [specific: proposal, data access terms,
research examples]. Then we can schedule a follow-up call in a week or two, and I can connect
you with [specific person: research director, other faculty, student testimonials]."

If not interested: "Totally understand. If anything changes, or if you think of colleagues
who might be interested, feel free to reach out. And if you have any other questions about
FOR THE KIDS, just ask."

CLOSE:
"Thanks again for your time. Really appreciated the conversation."
```

```
OPENING (2 min):
"Hi [Name], thanks for making time for a follow-up. I've been thinking about our last
conversation and put together a specific proposal for [University Name] based on what
you mentioned about [their specific priorities]."

RECAP (3 min):
"Last time we talked, you mentioned [specific pain point or opportunity]. You said
[specific quote]. Based on that, I put together three options for how FOR THE KIDS
could help."

OPTION PRESENTATION (20-30 min):
Present 3 tiers, let them choose. Use this structure:

"Here are three ways we could work together:

OPTION 1: [BASIC] - [Title] ($[X] investment)
What we do:
- [Specific deliverable 1]
- [Specific deliverable 2]
- [Specific deliverable 3]

What you do:
- [Time/participation required]

Timeline: [Months X-Y]
Success looks like: [Specific metric]
Example: [Peer university that did this]

---

OPTION 2: [MEDIUM] - [Title] ($[X] investment)
[Same structure]

---

OPTION 3: [DEEP] - [Title] ($[X] investment)
[Same structure]

---

Which of these resonates most with what you need?"

CUSTOMIZE BASED ON RESPONSE (5-10 min):
Listen to which option they gravitate toward. Customize:
- Timeline (fit their semester/academic calendar)
- Scope (match their bandwidth)
- Metrics (what they actually care about measuring)
- Details (use their specific language about priorities)

ADDRESS CONCERNS (5-10 min):
Common objections + responses:

"How do I know this is legitimate / you'll actually deliver?"
Response: "Great question. We have [X universities/companies] already partnering.
Here's [case study / testimonial / reference contact]. And I'll give you monthly
updates on whatever metrics matter to you."

"My students are already busy. What's the time commitment?"
Response: "Totally understand. The ambassadors we recruit choose 3-5 hours/month.
For you, as the faculty partner, you'd do [X specific hours]. We handle the rest."

"How is this different from [other platform/company]?"
Response: "[Key difference: 60% to charity, transparent, student-focused, etc.]
The difference is [specific example of how we're different]."

"I need to think about this / discuss with [colleague]."
Response: "Completely understandable. When would be a good time to check back in?
And is there anything else you need to make a decision - testimonials, case studies,
specific data access info?"

COMMITMENT ASK (2-3 min):
"So here's what I'm thinking: Let's move forward with [Option X] and start with
[specific first step: intro to department chair, recruiting ambassador cohort, etc.].
We'll plan to [timeline], and then reassess after [first milestone] to see if we
should continue or adjust."

"I'll send you a simple one-pager documenting what we agreed to. Does that work?"

CLOSE (1 min):
"This is going to be great. [Name], I really appreciate you advocating for [University].
Looking forward to working together."
```

---

### SCRIPT 3: Objection Handling (Quick Reference)

```
OBJECTION 1: "We're not sure we have time for this."
RESPONSE: "That's totally fair. Let's start small - what if we just did [smallest option]
and proved it works? Then we can scale if you want."

OBJECTION 2: "Our students already have a lot of options."
RESPONSE: "Agreed. That's why FOR THE KIDS is different - [key differentiator: real
equity, transparent giving, meaningful project, etc.]. It's not just another platform."

OBJECTION 3: "What about liability / student safety / [other concern]?"
RESPONSE: "Great question. We have [insurance / safety measures / agreements in place].
Here's our [policy document / agreement]. Happy to discuss specifics."

OBJECTION 4: "This sounds like unpaid marketing for your company."
RESPONSE: "I understand the skepticism. Here's how we're different: [60% goes to charity,
we pay ambassadors, students get real equity opportunity, etc.]. This is genuinely about
impact first, marketing second."

OBJECTION 5: "We only work with established companies / platforms."
RESPONSE: "Totally understand wanting to work with proven players. We're still early,
which is actually the advantage - your students get to help shape [University]'s
relationship with a mission-driven company from the ground up. Plus, [reference customer
/ university / investor] is already partnering."

OBJECTION 6: "Can I talk to [other department / peer university]?"
RESPONSE: "Absolutely. Let me connect you with [specific contact: faculty at peer
university, student ambassador, campus partner]. They can speak to their experience."

OBJECTION 7: "We need to go through procurement / legal / [institutional process]."
RESPONSE: "Of course. I can work with [relevant office] on the agreement. Here's our
[standard contract / terms / liability insurance]. What's the next step in your process?"

OBJECTION 8: "I'm interested but need to talk to [colleague / dean / committee]."
RESPONSE: "Smart. Here's what might help: [brief, sharable overview document].
When would be a good time for me to discuss with [colleague / committee]?
Or I can send materials and you can socialize first."

- Paid internship opportunities
- Conference travel support

---

**Emphasize:**
- Gospel V1.3 hardcoded social commitment
- Verified pediatric charities (transparency validation)
- Real children helped metrics
- Student voice in impact decisions

**Adjust Messaging:**
- Lead with mission, not technology
- Use outcomes language (lives improved, not features shipped)
- Emphasize transparency (quarterly audits, blockchain verification)

---

### Customization 3: Startup/Entrepreneurship Culture (Stanford, UC Berkeley)

**Emphasize:**
- Founding opportunity (early employee, equity potential)
- Scaling challenge (fun for ambitious students)
- VC ecosystem validation
- Founder access (Joshua + team office hours)

**Adjust Tone:**

## FINAL NOTES

### Best Practices

1. **Personalization is key:** Every email should reference something specific about the university/professor
2. **Respect their time:** Be concise, clear, specific in every communication
3. **Give before asking:** Offer value (research data, student opportunities) before asking for commitment
4. **Use social proof:** Reference other universities/faculty doing similar work
5. **Follow up persistently but respectfully:** Multiple touchpoints (email, warm intro, etc.) are necessary
6. **Customize by discipline:** CS professors care about research; business professors care about student skills; education professors care about social impact
7. **Use their language:** If they talk about "outcomes," use that word. If they mention "scalability," echo it back.

### Red Flags (When Not to Pursue)

- No response after 3 genuine attempts
- Explicitly says "not interested right now"
- University has strict non-profit partnerships only policy
- Professor is already overcommitted to partnerships
- Misalignment on core values (if they're skeptical of social mission, move on)

### Home Run Signals (When to Increase Investment)

- Enthusiastic response with specific questions
- Wants to involve colleagues/dean
- Mentions concrete timeline/semester for integration
- Asks about customization/expansion opportunities
- Connects you to other universities/contacts
