n=window.pintrk;n.queue=[],n.version="3.0";var
t=document.createElement("script");t.async=!0,t.src=e;var
r=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
r.parentNode.insertBefore(t,r)}}("https://s.pinimg.com/ct/core.js");
pintrk('load', 'YOUR_PINTEREST_TAG_ID', {em: '<user_email_address>'});
pintrk('page');
</script>
```
