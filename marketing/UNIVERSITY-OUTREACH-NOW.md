## 2. COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT COLLABORATION PITCH

### SUBJECT: AI Ethics Case Study Partnership - FOR THE KIDS Platform

Dear [CS Department Chair/Faculty Lead],

I'm reaching out to propose a collaboration between FOR THE KIDS and [University] Computer Science Department that would benefit students, faculty, and children's charities simultaneously.

#### THE PLATFORM

FOR THE KIDS is an AI-powered platform with an immutable ethical commitment: 60% of all revenue goes to verified pediatric charities. This isn't marketing—it's encoded in our smart contracts and governance structure.

We've built a production system that includes:
- Claude Opus 4.5 AI integration
- Blockchain-based DAO governance
- Automated charity verification
- Multi-node infrastructure (hybrid cloud/on-prem)
- Real-time transparency dashboard

#### EDUCATIONAL VALUE FOR YOUR STUDENTS

**1. AI Ethics in Practice**
- Real-world case study of ethical AI constraints
- Discussion of "immutable ethics" vs "flexible optimization"
- Bias mitigation in charity verification algorithms
- Transparency requirements in AI decision-making

**2. System Architecture**
- Hybrid cloud infrastructure design
- Distributed systems and fault tolerance
- API security and authentication
- Database design for compliance/audit requirements

**3. Blockchain & Governance**
- Smart contract development (Solidity/Ethereum)
- DAO voting mechanisms
- On-chain/off-chain data coordination
- Token economics for charitable platforms

#### PROPOSED COLLABORATION MODELS

**Option A: Guest Lecture Series (Low Commitment)**
- 2-3 lectures per semester on ethical AI development
- Q&A with founder and engineering team
- No cost to department
- **We provide:** Speaker, presentation materials, pizza for students

**Option B: Capstone Project Partnership (Medium Commitment)**
- Senior students build features for production platform
- Real PRs reviewed by our engineering team
- Resume-worthy open-source contributions
- **We provide:** Technical mentorship, $2,500 project stipend

**Option C: Research Collaboration (High Commitment)**
- Joint research on AI ethics, charitable giving, or governance
- Access to anonymized platform data
- Co-authorship on publications
- **We provide:** $10,000 research fund, data access, technical support

**Option D: Full Department Partnership (Maximum Commitment)**
- All of the above plus:
- $25,000 annual department sponsorship
- 5 paid student ambassador positions
- Hackathon sponsorships
- Internship pipeline
- **We provide:** $50,000+ annual investment in students and programs

#### WHY THIS MATTERS

Your students will graduate into a world where AI ethics isn't theoretical—it's a competitive advantage. Companies are scrambling to build "responsible AI" teams. Students who can demonstrate real-world ethical AI development have a massive resume advantage.

Plus, their work directly helps sick kids. That's a pretty good day at the office.

#### NEXT STEPS

I'd love to schedule a 20-minute call to discuss what makes sense for your program. I'm flexible and happy to customize this to your curriculum and research priorities.
