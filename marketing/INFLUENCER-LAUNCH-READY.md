### EMAIL TEMPLATE 1: THE MISSION-FIRST APPROACH (Philanthropy Niche)
**Best For**: Nonprofits, cause advocates, charitable organizations
**Conversion Rate Target**: 45-60%
**Subject**: "60% of revenue to charity - creator partnership at FOR THE KIDS"

```
Hello [NAME],

I came across your recent work on [SPECIFIC CAUSE/CONTENT] and was genuinely impressed.
Your community clearly values [SHARED VALUE], and that's exactly why I'm reaching out.

We just launched FOR THE KIDS (https://aidoesitall.website) - an AI platform with
a specific, immutable mission:

**60% of ALL revenue goes directly to Verified Pediatric Charities.**

Not 20%. Not 40%. Sixty percent. It's hardcoded in our smart contract on Base blockchain
and enforced by Claude AI to ensure the code never deviates. Gospel V1.3 is the law.

The Complete Breakdown:
- 60% ? Verified Pediatric Charities (like Shriners Children's Hospital)
- 30% ? Infrastructure & reinvestment
- 10% ? Founder (intentionally minimal - Joshua Coleman took a pay cut)

Why This Matters:
We're proving that profitable companies can prioritize kids. This isn't a contribution
model or treasury scheme. It's profit allocation. Every customer purchase automatically
splits 60/30/10 through smart contracts.

The Partnership Offer:
- 20% affiliate commission on sales through your unique link
- Transparent tracking dashboard (real-time conversions)
- Content brief you can customize however you like
- Full Gospel compliance guarantee
- Zero pressure - only post if you genuinely believe in it

What We've Already Accomplished:
- goal: help thousands of children through AI services
- First $60K directly to Shriners Children's Hospital (pending final partnership)
- Smart contract: Planned (Q1 2026) (publicly verifiable)

Why I'm Reaching Out to You Specifically:
[PERSONALIZED REASON - reference their recent content, cause focus, audience alignment]

Next Steps:
I'd love to send you:
1. One-page overview with smart contract proof
2. Dashboard access so you can track everything
3. Flexible content brief (your creative, our guidelines)

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call this week? Or I can send everything
via email if that works better.

What's your preference?

For the Kids,
[YOUR NAME]
[TITLE]
FOR THE KIDS
hello@aidoesitall.website
https://aidoesitall.website

P.S. - Gospel V1.3 is immutable. The 60% to kids can never change, even if you wanted it to.
That's the whole point.

### EMAIL TEMPLATE 2: THE AUDIENCE RELEVANCE APPROACH (Tech/Lifestyle Niche)
**Best For**: Tech reviewers, lifestyle influencers, parenting creators
**Conversion Rate Target**: 30-35%
**Subject**: "AI platform with a mission - creator partnership opportunity"

```
Hi [NAME],

I've been following your content on [SPECIFIC TOPIC] for a while now. What strikes me
most is how your audience is genuinely engaged - that kind of authentic connection is rare.

I wanted to reach out about something we're building that might align with your values.

FOR THE KIDS is an AI-powered marketplace (https://aidoesitall.website) where
60% of revenue funds Verified Pediatric Charities. The unique angle: We're not asking
for contributions. We're allocating profits from our actual product sales.

The Model:
- 60% ? Children's hospitals and verified pediatric charities
- 30% ? Tech infrastructure and operations
- 10% ? Founder (minimal but fair)

Gospel V1.3 enforces this through smart contracts. If you understand blockchain, you
understand why this matters - it's Transparent, not trust-based.

Why I'm Reaching Out:
Your audience is exactly the demographic that values:
? Transparency over marketing BS
? Technology with purpose
? Giving that actually works
? Smart spending decisions

Creator Partnership Details:
- 20% affiliate commission on sales through your link
- Transparent dashboard to track your conversions in real-time
- Pre-written content brief (but your voice, your creative)
- No exclusivity requirements
- No minimum posting frequency

How It Works:
1. You get unique affiliate code: CREATOR_[YOUR_NAME]
2. Share with your audience when/how it feels authentic
3. Track earnings on transparent dashboard
4. Receive commission monthly

The Differentiator:
Most platforms want you to promote something profitable. We want you to promote
something that helps kids. There's a difference.

Proof You Can Verify:
- Smart contract on Base: Planned (Q1 2026)
- Currently helping thousands of children- Open to third-party audits

Would you be interested in a quick 5-minute call to chat about this?
Or I can send a one-pager if email is easier.

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
ON BEHALF OF FOR THE KIDS
https://aidoesitall.website

P.S. - The Gospel V1.3 split isn't negotiable. It's the foundation everything is built on.

**Best For**: Lifestyle, parenting, values-driven audiences
**Conversion Rate Target**: 32-38%
**Subject**: "Why we built FOR THE KIDS (and why you might want to promote it)"

```
Hi [NAME],

I'm writing because your recent content about [SHARED VALUES] really resonated
with how we're thinking about business.

HERE'S THE BACKSTORY:

Our founder Joshua Coleman built FOR THE KIDS because he believed AI tools should
create value for people, not just extract it.

So he did something simple: He set it up so 60% of every transaction goes directly
to Verified Pediatric Charities. Not 60%. Not as a "charitable program."
60% by design, from day one.

**The hardest part?** Convincing people it's real.

That's why we used smart contracts on blockchain. Gospel V1.3 enforcement means:
- Nobody (not even Joshua) can change the split
- Every allocation is public and verifiable
- Claude AI audits code changes to ensure compliance

**The numbers:**
- goal: help thousands of children through AI services
- First $60K to Shriners Children's Hospital
- Smart contract: Planned (Q1 2026)

**Why we're reaching out:**

We want to partner with creators who see business as a tool for good.
Not influencers who'll say anything for a check, but people like you who
have real values and real impact with your audience.

**The offer:**
- 20% commission on sales your audience generates
- Full transparency on tracking and payouts
- Content brief you can make your own
- Partnership only if it feels right to you

**What made us reach out to you specifically:**
[PERSONALIZED REASON BASED ON THEIR CONTENT]

**The bottom line:**

You help people think differently. We've built a platform that proves
business can prioritize kids. Together, we can show your audience that
technology can be a force for good.

Anyway, I wanted to put this on your radar. No pressure if it's not the right
time or fit.

If you're interested, reply and we can chat.

For the Kids,
[YOUR NAME]
Joshua Coleman, Founder
https://aidoesitall.website
joshlcoleman@gmail.com

P.S. - Your community clearly cares about [SPECIFIC VALUE]. We do too.
That's why this matters.

### COLLABORATION IDEA 4: "THE AUTHENTIC REVIEW" (Tech/Lifestyle)
**Format**: Single detailed post or video (3-8 minutes)
**Platform**: Instagram Reel, TikTok, YouTube Short
**Best For**: Tech reviewers, lifestyle influencers

```
SCRIPT STRUCTURE:

[0:00-0:15] HOOK
"I tested an AI platform that gives 60% of profits to children's hospitals.
Here's why it's different from every other 'ethical' tech company."

[0:15-0:45] THE FIRST IMPRESSION
Show yourself using the platform. Natural, authentic.
"Okay, so first time using it. Interface is clean. Setup is easy.
Performance is [HONEST TAKE]."

[0:45-1:30] THE GOSPEL V1.3 PART
"But the real differentiator isn't the interface. It's the model."
[Show infographic or your annotation]
"60% of revenue ? kids' hospitals. 30% ? operations. 10% ? founder.
And it's not just marketing. It's a smart contract on blockchain."

[1:30-2:30] THE PROOF
"I verified it myself. Smart contract 0x9855B75... on Base blockchain.
I'm not a crypto bro, but this is actually Transparent allocation.
They can't change it even if they wanted to."

[2:30-4:00] THE HONEST TAKE
"Is it perfect? No. [Mention any limitations]
Is the 60% enough to cover costs? Apparently yes, but it's tight.
Do I think the founder is being genuine? Yeah, I do. He took a 10% cut
to make this work."

[4:00-5:00] IMPACT
"Current count: goal: help thousands of children helped. Real number. Blockchain proof."

[5:00-6:00] THE ASK
"If you're going to use an AI platform anyway, might as well use one that
helps kids. Use code CREATOR_[YOUR_NAME] or link in bio."

[6:00] END CARD
"I get commission. I'm transparent about it. But I wouldn't promote it
if I didn't actually think it was worth using."

## GOSPEL-COMPLIANT COMPENSATION MODELS

All creator compensation must respect Gospel V1.3. Here are the approved models.

### COMPENSATION MODEL 1: AFFILIATE COMMISSION (PRIMARY)
**Best For**: All influencer tiers
**Gospel Compliance**: YES - Respects 60/30/10 split

```
BASE STRUCTURE:
20% commission on customer sales through influencer's link

CALCULATION:
Customer pays: $100
Company revenue: $100
+- To charity (60%): $60
+- To infrastructure (30%): $30
+- To founder (10%): $10

Influencer commission: $20 (comes from the above allocation)
```

This model is Gospel-compliant because:
- Affiliate payments come out of normal business operations
- The 60/30/10 split is maintained regardless of affiliate payments
- Influencer incentives don't compete with charity allocation
- Scaling affiliates doesn't reduce charity percentage

---

### COMPENSATION MODEL 2: PERFORMANCE BONUSES
**Best For**: High-performing micro and mid-tier influencers
**Gospel Compliance**: YES - Optional bonus tier

```
BASE: 20% commission (standard)

TIER 1 BONUS:
If influencer generates 5+ conversions in a month
+5% bonus commission (total: 25%)
Example: $500 sales ? $125 commission instead of $100

TIER 2 BONUS:
If influencer generates 15+ conversions in a month
+10% bonus commission (total: 30%)
Example: $1,500 sales ? $450 commission instead of $300

TIER 3 BONUS:
If influencer generates 50+ conversions in a month
+15% bonus commission (total: 35%)
Example: $5,000 sales ? $1,750 commission instead of $1,000

RESET: Monthly (bonuses don't roll over)
```

This model is Gospel-compliant because:
- Bonuses incentivize volume, not deviation from mission
- All bonus tiers come from sustainable margins
- Charity percentage never decreases
- Founder percentage never increases to accommodate bonuses

---

### COMPENSATION MODEL 3: RETAINER + COMMISSION (Macro/Celebrity)
**Best For**: Tier 1-2 influencers, ambassadors, celebrities
**Gospel Compliance**: YES - Separate from revenue split

```
STRUCTURE:
Monthly retainer (flat fee) + performance commission

EXAMPLE:
Retainer: $500/month (guaranteed)
Base commission: 20% on sales
Bonus structure: Available (same as Model 2)

CALCULATION:
If influencer drives $2,000 in sales:
Commission: $400 (20%)
Bonus (if applicable): +$50 (Tier 1)
Retainer: $500
Total compensation: $950

OR if no sales:
Just retainer: $500
(No commission but guaranteed payment)
```

This model is Gospel-compliant because:
- Retainer comes from standard operational budget (not charity)
- Commission structure unchanged (same 20% base)
- Overall business model (60/30/10) still intact
- Retainers don't incentivize mission compromise

---

### COMPENSATION MODEL 4: BONUS FOR GOSPEL ADVOCACY
**Best For**: Creators who actively educate audience on Gospel V1.3
**Gospel Compliance**: YES - Rewards mission alignment

```
BONUS STRUCTURE:
"Gospel Education Bonus" - Additional compensation for teaching audience
about Gospel V1.3 and smart contract transparency

ELIGIBILITY:
- Dedicated content explaining 60/30/10 split
- Smart contract verification shown/explained
- Emphasis on immutability and Transparent allocation
- Audience education angle (not just promotion)

BONUS TIERS:
- Tier 1: $50 bonus for first Gospel-focused piece
- Tier 2: $100 bonus if post generates 1,000+ engagement
- Tier 3: $200 bonus if multiple Gospel-focused pieces generate 5,000+ combined engagement

MONTHLY CAP: $300 maximum bonus (to prevent over-emphasis)

CALCULATION (Example):
Base sales commission: $200
Gospel education bonus: $75
Total: $275
```

This model is Gospel-compliant because:
- Rewards transparency and education (mission-aligned)
- Doesn't compromise charity allocation
- Incentivizes authentic Gospel advocacy
- Capped to maintain balance

---

### COMPENSATION MODEL 5: AFFILIATE PAYMENT SCHEDULE
**How/When Influencers Get Paid**

```
STANDARD PAYMENT SCHEDULE:
- Tracking period: Full calendar month
- Commission calculation: By 5th of following month
- Payment issued: By 15th of following month (within 2 weeks)

? Payment issued by end of Month 3

TAX DOCUMENTATION:
- 1099 issued if annual earnings > $600
- Issued by January 31 for prior year
- Influencer responsible for self-employment tax
```

---

### COMPENSATION MODEL 6: PAYMENT HOLD (Compliance Check)
**Gospel Compliance Safety Valve**

```
PAYMENT HOLD CLAUSE:
To protect Gospel V1.3 compliance, FOR THE KIDS reserves right to
hold payment (24-48 hours) if promotional content violates compliance.

TRIGGERS FOR HOLD:
- Content uses forbidden language ("contribute", "treasury", "")
- Content misrepresents Gospel allocation
- Content makes unverified impact claims
- Content violates FTC disclosure requirements
- Content contradicts mission statement

HOLD PROCESS:
1. Content reviewed flagged for non-compliance (within 24 hours)
2. FOR THE KIDS notifies influencer of issue
3. Influencer has 24 hours to:
   a) Remove problematic content, OR
   b) Provide explanation/justification
4. If resolved: payment processed
5. If not resolved: payment may be withheld pending Gospel review

APPEALS PROCESS:
If influencer disputes hold decision:
- Request review from Joshua Coleman (joshlcoleman@gmail.com)
- 48-hour review window
- Final decision binding

This ensures:
- Gospel V1.3 maintained at all times
- Influencer compensation never used to corrupt mission
- Transparent compliance framework
```
