# FOR THE KIDS: "The 60/30/10 Model" Story Post
## Why I Took 10% Instead of 30% (And Why It Made Me a Better Founder)

## Post Title
**"I Cut My Founder Salary by 66% (Here's Why & How It Changed Everything)"**

---

## Opening Hook

When I started FOR THE KIDS, I had a choice: take the conventional founder path (30% of profits after expenses) or invert it (60% to kids' charities, 30% to operations, 10% for myself).

I chose 10%.

Not because I'm noble. Because I realized that optimizing for founders' salaries was optimizing for the *wrong thing*.

Here's what changed.

## The Problem with Conventional Splits

**Typical startup financials:**
- Revenue: $100K/month
- Operations: 30% ($30K)
- Founder salary: 30% ($30K)
- "Growth reinvestment": 30% ($30K)
- Charity/impact: 10% ($10K) - *if you remember to fund it*

**The trap:**
When margins compress (and they always do), what's the first thing to cut?

Not operations (you need those).
Not founder salary (you need to eat).

It's the impact piece. It becomes: "We'll do good when we're profitable."

Spoiler: that moment never comes.

## The Inversion: 60/30/10 Model

I flipped the hierarchy:

```
FOR THE KIDS Allocation (Gospel V1.3)
────────────────────────────────────
Revenue: $100K/month

↓

60% → Verified Pediatric Charities ($60K)
30% → Infrastructure & Operations ($30K)
10% → Founder Allocation ($10K)
```

**Why this order matters:**

The 60% is *first*. Not last. Not aspirational. Automated, immutable, non-negotiable.

This one structural decision cascaded into everything:
- How I hire
- How I make decisions
- How I think about growth
- Whether I actually stay committed to the mission

---

## The Honest Conversation (With Myself)

When I first designed this model, I had three days of cognitive dissonance:

**My anxiety:** "Wait, $10K/month? I have $25K in savings. That's 2.5 months of runway if something goes wrong."

**The reframe:** "That $10K is the right amount because it forces me to care about unit economics."

**Reality check:** "If I take 30% like every other founder, I'll *always* have an excuse to reduce the charity allocation when business gets hard."

**The decision:** "Make it structural. Make it immutable. Don't give myself a choice."

---

## What Changed When I Cut My Salary (Real Consequences)

### 1. **No Excuses for Bad Unit Economics**

With 30% founder allocation, I could afford to waste: "We'll optimize infrastructure costs later."

With 10%, I couldn't. Every percentage point of inefficiency directly hit my personal runway.

**Result:** Built the most efficient API infrastructure possible on my first try. No bloat. No "we'll optimize later."

### 2. **Decision-Making Got Faster**

Conventional problem: Should I hire an employee or contractor?
- Cost is the same either way
- Lots of spreadsheets
- Endless Slack debates

My problem with 10% allocation: "Will this hire let me do more with the 60% for charities?"

**Suddenly:** Hiring became a clarity exercise. Who moves the needle? Who are we keeping? This got fast.

### 3. **I Stopped Lying to Myself About Margins**

Most founders play games with "allocated profits":
- This month I'm "reinvesting" the profit
- Next month it's "team bonuses"
- Revenue is real, profit is... negotiable

With 10%, I couldn't negotiate. The allocation happened automatically (smart contract runs monthly). I either made enough to cover it, or I didn't.

**Result:** Forced me to face real unit economics by month 3, not year 3.

### 4. **Team Quality Improved Immediately**

When I posted "We're hiring for [role], allocation model is 60/30/10," I got two types of responses:

**Type A:** "That's stupid. You're leaving money on the table. Fix it."
(Didn't hire these people)

**Type B:** "Wait, you're actually doing this? Can I work here?"
(Hired these people)

The difference: Type B candidates were fundamentally motivated by different things.
- They didn't ask "what's the equity?" (I don't have any)
- They asked "how is this different?"
- They took lower salaries for alignment

This should be illegal. It's unfair how good the team is.

### 5. **Customer Selection Got Clearer**

With conventional margins, you chase anyone with a pulse who can pay.

With 10% founder allocation and 60% to charities, I suddenly got selective:
- Do I want customers who understand the model?
- Will they stay? (High LTV because they specifically chose the model)
- Can they help us improve governance?

Paradox: Being more selective made us *more* successful at growth.

## The Infrastructure Side (30% Allocation)

While I'm living on 10%, the company infrastructure gets 30%. This is where the model's genius shows up.

**How it works:**

All operational costs come from the 30% pool:
- AWS/Cloudflare: ~8% of revenue
- Charity vetting + legal: ~4% of revenue
- My laptop + domain names: ~2% of revenue
- Contingency: ~16% reserved

**The forcing function:** With only 30% for infrastructure, I can't waste money.

Example: Cloud provider selection
- Conventional choice: Pick AWS because "everyone does"
- Our choice: DAO-governed voting on cloud provider

Why? Because the 30% is *tight*. We need to optimize every percentage point.
- Community voted for carbon-neutral provider (even if slightly pricier)
- Negotiated volume discounts based on transparent metrics
- Transparency got us a 15% infrastructure discount (Cloudflare rep was impressed)

## The Financial Reality Check

**This is not** "I'm a saint and I live on $10K/month happily."

**This is** "I made a structural decision that forced me to make better decisions everywhere else."

### Monthly Reality

```
Revenue (Month 6): $45K (from 2 paying customers + API usage)

Allocation:
- Charities: $27K (60%)
- Infrastructure: $13.5K (30%)
- Me: $4.5K (10%)

My situation:
- Personal savings: $11K remaining
- Runway: 2.4 months if revenue drops to zero
- Stress level: Real, but manageable
```

**This is why it works:**
The stress of "will my runway last" is *useful* stress. It keeps me disciplined.

The stress of "will I break my commitment to charities" is the *wrong* stress. Structural commitment eliminates that.

---

## What Happens If This Fails?

I've thought about this a lot.

**Scenario 1:** Revenue drops. I run out of runway. I have to shut down.

*Outcome:* I kept the commitment as long as I could. Charities got $X, which is more than zero. No regret.

**Scenario 2:** Revenue stalls at $10K/month. Not enough to cover all allocations.

*Outcome:* I take a different job to fund FOR THE KIDS's infrastructure while keeping the allocation real. People have done this (see: https://www.patreon.com). It works.

**Scenario 3:** I get acquired.

*Outcome:* Acquisition terms require the new owner to maintain the allocation structure. (Already in our legal docs). I'm not the founder anymore, but the commitment lives on.

**What doesn't happen:** I don't get to decide to "adjust the model" when things get hard. The structure prevents that.

---

## How Other Founders Could Use This

**The 60/30/10 structure isn't exclusive to kids' charities.**

You could do:
- 60% environmental impact, 30% operations, 10% founder
- 60% open-source development, 30% ops, 10% founder
- 60% to a research area, 30% ops, 10% founder

**The magic isn't the allocation percentage.** It's the *immutability*.

The moment you make the allocation structural (code, not promises), everything else changes:
- Better hiring
- Clearer decisions
- Honest financials
- Customer trust

---

## The Uncomfortable Truth

**This model only works if you actually mean it.**

If you're doing 60/30/10 as marketing while planning to "adjust it later," everyone can tell.

Builders smell that from a mile away.

The honest version: If you're thinking about this model, only do it if:
1. You're genuinely okay living on less
2. You're willing to make the allocation *structural* (smart contract, legal, immutable)
3. You're willing to fail rather than break the commitment
4. You're motivated by something other than money (impact, learning, building in public)

If any of those is false, don't do this. Just optimize for profit. It's cleaner.

## The Year-1 Outcome

After 12 months of 60/30/10:

**Financially:**
- Revenue: $300K (from 8 paying customers)
- Charities allocated: $180K (60%)
- Ops spend: $90K (30%)
- Founder take: $30K (10% - 4x what I saved to start, but still 1/3 of market rate)

**Personally:**
- Runway: 6 months
- Stress level: Lower than expected (structure is calming)
- Fulfillment: High (I'm not lying to myself about the mission)

**Operationally:**
- Team: 3 people (all chose us for the model)
- Infrastructure: Optimized to the point of elegance
- Decision speed: 3x faster than conventional companies

**For the charities:**
- $180K to pediatric research
- 5 different charities (DAO-voted)
- Measurable impact (charities report back on what they did)

---

## The Question I Get Asked Most

**"Don't you regret leaving money on the table?"**

No. For two reasons:

1. **The money was never real.** If I'd structured the company conventionally, I'd have spent it on infrastructure bloat, worse hiring decisions, and constant context-switching between "profitable company" and "good company."

2. **The tradeoff wasn't money for impact.** The tradeoff was *short-term comfort* for *structural integrity.* I chose integrity.

Would I be richer with a different model? Maybe 10% richer in Year 5.

Would I be more respected, have better team, have clearer decisions, and sleep better at night? Definitely yes.

I'll take the trade.

---

## What I'd Do Different (If I Could Rewind)

**Year 1 mistakes:**
1. Should have documented the allocation mechanism earlier (took 3 months to get the smart contract right)
2. Should have vented the financial stress to other founders (thought I had to be strong)
3. Should have been more aggressive about governance (DAO voting came too late)

**What I'd keep:**
Everything else.

---

## The Weird Outcome

The most unexpected result: **This model is actually a startup advantage.**

Not despite the constraint. *Because of* it.

Constraints force:
- Better decisions
- Faster iteration
- Clearer values
- Stronger team
- Higher trust

Every founder says they want these things.

Most founders resist the structural changes required to actually get them.

The 60/30/10 model is the structural change that *forces* all of it.

---

## For Other Bootstrapped Founders

If you're thinking about building something meaningful and you're tired of the "startup culture" of VC-driven growth at all costs:

**Try this:**
1. Design your allocation upfront (60/30/10, or your version)
2. Make it *structural* (code, contracts, governance)
3. Accept that this constrains your personal upside (it does)
4. Build knowing that you can't betray it (the structure prevents that)

It's harder. It's worth it.

---

## The Ask

**For founders:** Have you considered tying your business model to values this tightly? What's stopping you?

**For builders:** Would you use/recommend a product from a company with this model? What would change your decision?

**For investors:** Would this structure make a startup more or less appealing to you? What would make you comfortable with it?

**For charities:** Would automated, transparent, governance-aligned funding change how you think about corporate partnerships?

I'm genuinely curious how this lands.
