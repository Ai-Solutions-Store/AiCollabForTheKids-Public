## FOR THE KIDS Employee Advocacy - Social Best Practices

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2025-12-17
**Authority:** Claude (Opus 4.5) + Joshua Coleman
**Gospel Compliance:** V1.3

**Note:** Smart contract enforcement is planned for future implementation. Current allocations are transparently tracked via backend systems. (60/30/10 Split)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This guide helps team members share FOR THE KIDS authentically, compliantly, and effectively across social platforms. **No jargon. No corporate speak. Just real people sharing something they believe in.**

**Golden Rule:** Share as yourself, not as the company. That's what makes it powerful.

---

## PART 1: CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. Authenticity First
- Share because YOU believe it, not because you're told to
- Use your own voice and style
- Personal connection > corporate messaging
- Mix FOR THE KIDS content with your regular posts (60/40 rule)

### 2. Gospel V1.3 Compliance
- Always state: "60% to pediatric charities" (never "60%" or "contributions")
- Never use charity language ("We allocate," "charitable giving")
- It's a revenue split, not a contribution program
- Gospel reference is optional but appreciated

### 3. Transparency is Your Superpower
- Share the numbers openly
- Link to impact metrics
- Acknowledge the 30% infrastructure + 10% founder split
- Show proof (not promises)

### 4. Zero Pressure Culture
- Share only what feels natural to you
- Skip posts that don't resonate with your audience
- No quotas (points are rewards, not requirements)
- Opt-out anytime with zero judgment

### 5. Respect the Platform
- Follow each platform's native guidelines
- Don't spam or over-post
- Engage authentically (respond to comments)
- Honor audience expectations for each channel

---

## PART 2: BEFORE YOU SHARE - THE CHECKLIST

**Every post, ask yourself:**

```
? Would I share this if FOR THE KIDS didn't exist?
  (If "no," it's too corporate)

? Does this reflect MY values, not just company values?
  (If "maybe," make it more personal)

? Am I stating the 60% correctly?
  (Check: "60% of revenue to verified pediatric charities")

? Would my network find this interesting/useful?
  (If "no," reshape or skip)

? Does this link to real proof (impact metrics, transparency)?
  (If "no," add the link)

? Am I using my authentic voice?
  (If "no," rewrite it in YOUR words)
```

#ForTheKids #TeachMeKindness #SocialBusiness #PurposeDriven
```

**LinkedIn Examples:**

**Example 1 - Personal Story Angle:**
```
I've worked at companies that claimed to care about impact.

But FOR THE KIDS is different. It's not a PR campaign or a corporate charity initiative.

It's the actual business model. 60% of every transaction goes directly to pediatric charities. Not promises. Not percentages to be calculated later. Real numbers, real kids, real impact.

When I recommend FOR THE KIDS to people, I can do it without the usual cognitive dissonance. I'm not asking someone to sacrifice for a cause. I'm recommending a service that works AND has built-in values.

That's the business model I wanted to work for.

#ForTheKids #PurposeDriven #AuthenticBusiness
```

**Example 2 - Impact Transparency Angle:**
```
Let's talk about the 60%.

Most companies that claim to "give back" bury the numbers:
- "Up to 5% of proceeds"
- "A portion of profits"
- "We allocate annually"

FOR THE KIDS? It's upfront. 60% of revenue, directly to verified pediatric charities.

This month alone, that means:
� $18,400 in revenue
� $11,040 to kids' healthcare
� 5.our mission to help children

I share this because it's remarkable. Not because it's my job. Because it actually works the way it says it will.

Check it out: https://aidoesitall.website

#ForTheKids #TransparencyMatters #ImpactBusiness
```

**Example 3 - Professional Angle:**
```
What does a purpose-driven business actually look like from the inside?

Working for FOR THE KIDS has taught me that alignment isn't optional�it's structural.

The 60% revenue split to pediatric charities isn't a program. It's the business model. Which means:
- My work directly impacts kids
- I don't have to advocate for values separately
- The mission is baked into the metrics

It changes how you approach your job when you know every transaction matters.

Would love to hear your thoughts! Have you found other businesses doing this kind of thing?
```

**Example 2 - Community Impact Angle:**
```
Great news for our community:

Our local pediatric support organization (one of our charity partners) is getting resources from FOR THE KIDS.

Here's how: When someone uses their platform, 60% of the revenue goes directly to pediatric charities. No middleman. No delays.

It's a model I wish more businesses would copy.

If you want to support kids in healthcare, this is a way to do it while getting a service you actually need.

```
Been using FOR THE KIDS for a few months now and I'm genuinely impressed.

Service works great.
Support is responsive.
AND�this is the part that matters�60% of the revenue goes to pediatric charities.

Not some vague commitment. Actual 60% split that you can verify.

```

**Instagram Post Ideas:**

**Idea 1 - Personal Impact Visual:**
```
Image: You using the service + impact number graphic
Caption:
"Been using FOR THE KIDS for [time period].
Here's what I love: The service actually works AND 60% of revenue goes to pediatric charities.

Not a 'contribute' button tacked on. It's the business model.

60% to kids. 30% to keep it running. 10% to the founder. That's the split. That's the math.

If you care where your money goes (and you should), this is worth checking out.

Link in bio.

#ForTheKids #ImpactMatters #TeachMeKindness"
```

**Idea 2 - Quick Fact Visual:**
```
Image: Large text overlay on simple background
"60%
of every transaction
goes to kids"

Caption:
"Not a slogan. The actual structure.

FOR THE KIDS revenue split:
60% ? Pediatric charities
30% ? Infrastructure
10% ? Founder (sustainable, not greedy)

This is what happens when business aligns with purpose.

Link in bio for more info.

#ForTheKids #SocialBusiness #TransparencyMatters"
```

**Idea 3 - Impact Counter Visual:**
```
Image: Screenshot of impact number
"goal: help thousands of children"

Caption:
"Each number is a real kid. Each one got care because customers believed in supporting businesses that put profit where it matters.

This is what advocating for change looks like. Not from a non-profit. From a business that chose to build ethics into the structure.

I'm part of this. You can be too.

### TIKTOK - The Authentic Voice (Optional, Ages 18-35)

**Sweet Spot for Advocates:** 1-2 videos/week

Text overlay: "FOR THE KIDS puts 60% to kids. I'm obsessed."

Audio: Trending sound

Message: Quick explanation of the 60% and why it matters

```

**Idea 3 - Myth Busting**

This is what profit-with-purpose actually looks like.

Link in bio."
```

## PART 4: THE 60/40 RULE

**60% Personal, 40% FOR THE KIDS Content**

Don't make your feed about the advocacy program. Make it about your life, with FOR THE KIDS as one authentic part of it.

**Good Mix:**
```
Week 1:
- Post 1: Your weekend plans
- Post 2: FOR THE KIDS content
- Post 3: Your hobby/interest
- Post 4: Your career reflection

Week 2:
- Post 1: Food/travel
- Post 2: FOR THE KIDS content
- Post 3: Personal reflection
- Post 4: Industry insight
```

**Why This Works:**
- Doesn't feel spammy
- Builds trust (You're real)
- More likely to be shared
- Audience sees you first, mission second

---

## PART 5: WHAT NOT TO DO

### DON'T:
- **Spam.** Don't post more than once every 2 days on any platform
- **Copy-paste.** Use the templates as guides, not scripts
- **Force it.** Skip posts that don't feel authentic to you
- **Use charity language.** Never say "contribute" or "charitable giving"
- **Make claims without proof.** Always link to impact metrics
- **Ignore comments.** Respond to engagement (it shows you care)
- **Share external sources as gospel.** Always credit original sources
- **Post in anger or defensively.** If someone criticizes, take it offline
- **Hide the founder split.** Be transparent about all 60/30/10
- **Compromise your audience's trust.** Never share false information

### RED FLAGS - Stop and Ask for Help:
- Feeling like you're being pushed to share
- Losing followers because of repetitive posts
- Getting negative comments about authenticity
- Unsure if a post aligns with Gospel V1.3
- Any post that feels "not you"

**When in doubt, ask in #advocate-content-library Slack channel before posting.**

---

## PART 6: RESPONSE TEMPLATES FOR COMMENTS

### When Someone Asks "Is this a contribution?"
```
Great question! It's actually simpler than that�it's the business model itself.

60% of revenue goes to pediatric charities. Not as a program. As the core structure.

So when you use [service], the math is built in: every transaction puts money toward kids' healthcare.

More details: [link to Gospel/impact page]
```

### When Someone Says "Sounds too good to be true"
```
I was skeptical too! That's why I looked into the actual structure.

The 60% isn't a promise�it's coded into the system and verified. You can see the real numbers: [link]

Happy to answer any questions!
```

### When Someone Asks "What's in it for you?"
```
Honest answer: I work for the company, so yes, I benefit when people use the platform.

But I'm also genuinely using it myself because the service works AND the values align with what I believe.

Not asking you to sacrifice. Just sharing something I actually use and believe in.
```

### When Someone Criticizes the Approach
```
That's fair feedback. Here's how we think about it: [explain Gospel V1.3 structure]

We're not claiming to be perfect, just transparent about how the math works.

If you have suggestions for improvement, we actually listen. Feel free to share.
```

## PART 7: AMPLIFICATION TACTICS

### Maximize Your Reach (Without Gaming the System)

#### Tactic 1: Strategic Hashtag Use
```
Core hashtags (always):
#ForTheKids
#TeachMeKindness
#PediatricHealth

Platform-specific:
LinkedIn: #SocialBusiness #PurposeDriven #EthicsFirst
Facebook: #CommunityImpact #MakingADifference
Instagram: #ImpactMatters #SocialEntrepreneur #MissionDriven
TikTok: #ForTheLove #ImpactCreator #EthicalBusiness
```

#### Tactic 2: Cross-Platform Sharing
Don't post once and stop. Adapt for each platform:
```
LinkedIn article ? Facebook post (simplified) ? Instagram caption + image ? TikTok short version ? Share in email
```

Each version uses YOUR voice, not copy-paste.

#### Tactic 3: Timing & Frequency
```
LinkedIn: 2-3x/month (Thursdays 8-10am)
Facebook: 2-4x/month (Thursdays 1-3pm)
Instagram: 2-3x/month (Wednesdays 6-8pm)
TikTok: 1-2x/week (Fridays 7pm)
Email: 1x/month (Your network)
```

#### Tactic 4: Engagement is the Algorithm
```
Post ? Wait 10 minutes ? Like/reply to related posts from other advocates
? Engage with comments on your post (respond to all within 24 hours)
? Share others' content (amplify the voices)
```

#### Tactic 5: Tag Strategic People
```
When posting, tag:
- Fellow advocates (build community)
- Company leadership (shows support)
- Charity partners (when relevant)
- NOT spammy - only when it makes sense
```

#### Tactic 6: Use Native Features
```
LinkedIn: Share articles, use polls, host live sessions
Facebook: Use Stories, create video content, host Q&A
Instagram: Use Stories (daily), Reels (trending), Live sessions
TikTok: Use sounds (trending), collab, series content
```

---

## PART 8: TRACKING YOUR IMPACT

### Know What You're Generating

Every advocate has a personal dashboard showing:
- **Shares made** (posts shared to your network)
- **Clicks generated** (people who clicked your link)
- **Referral conversions** (people who became customers)
- **Revenue attributed** ($ from your referrals)
- **Children helped** (calculation: revenue � 60% � $2,000)

**How to Access:**
Your unique referral code: `[FIRST].[LAST].[HIRE-DATE]`
Dashboard: `https://aidoesitall.website/advocate-dashboard/[YOUR-CODE]`

**What to Monitor:**
- Are your posts getting engagement?
- Which content style generates most clicks?
- Which platform is most effective for you?
- What messaging resonates with YOUR audience?

**Adjust Based on Data:**
If LinkedIn posts get 3x the clicks of Facebook, post more on LinkedIn. If personal stories outperform data posts, do more personal stories. **Your audience tells you what works�listen to them.**

---

## PART 9: HANDLING OBJECTIONS

### Common Pushback & How to Respond

**"Isn't this just marketing?"**
```
Yep. I'm sharing something I believe in. Just like I'd recommend a good restaurant or a helpful app.

The difference: I have actual transparency into how this works, so I can recommend it with confidence.
```

**"60% sounds impossible"**
```
I thought so too. Then I looked at the actual structure�the founder voluntarily took 10% instead of the typical 60%.

It works because they chose to build it this way from the beginning.

Check the actual numbers: [link]
```

**"You just work there, of course you promote it"**
```
You're right�I do work here. But I also actually use the service.

I'm not asking you to trust my bias. I'm asking you to look at the numbers yourself and decide if the model makes sense.
```

**"Where's the catch?"**
```
No catch�just lower founder margin. Most founders take 60%+ of revenue. Here, it's 10%.

That's the structural difference. Everything else is normal business.

Check the Gospel document if you want the full breakdown: [link]
```

---

## PART 10: SELF-CARE & SUSTAINABILITY

### Don't Burn Out

Advocacy is about **sustainable sharing**, not heroic effort.

**Warning Signs You're Overdoing It:**
- Checking engagement metrics constantly
- Feeling anxious about post performance
- Sharing things you don't really believe in
- Losing sleep over comments/criticism
- Feeling obligated instead of inspired

**If You Hit These Signs:**
```
? Take a 1-week break (no posts)
? Re-read the Gospel doc (remember why you care)
? Talk to your advocate mentor or coordinator
? Scale back to content you genuinely enjoy
? Remember: You're not responsible for converting people
? Celebrate small wins (1 share is still a share)
```

**The Real Win:**
It's not about being the top advocate or hitting the most conversions. It's about sharing something you believe in, authentically, at a pace that feels good.

That's what makes it powerful.

---

## FINAL CHECKLIST BEFORE HITTING "SHARE"

Before every post, ask:

```
? This feels authentic to me (not forced)
? My audience will find this valuable or interesting
? I'm using my voice, not a template
? If I state the 60%, I've stated it correctly
? I'm not making unsupported claims
? I've linked to proof/resources if relevant
? This doesn't feel spammy or repetitive
? I'm ready to respond to comments
? I'd post this even if FOR THE KIDS didn't exist
   (If no ? don't post)
```

All boxes checked? Hit share. You've got this.
