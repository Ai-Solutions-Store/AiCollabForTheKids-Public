# FOR THE KIDS: Indie Hackers Implementation Guide
## Step-by-Step Execution Plan (Week 1 through Year 1)

---

## PHASE 0: Pre-Launch (Days 1-7)

### Day 1: Initial Review & Planning
**Time:** 2 hours

```
[ ] Read all four Indie Hackers marketing documents
[ ] Skim INDIE-HACKERS-STRATEGY.md (reference material)
[ ] Create 3-month content calendar
[ ] Identify your current metrics (for customization)
[ ] Choose username (Joshua Coleman recommended)
[ ] Select profile photo
```

**Decisions to make:**
1. Personal voice or "Claude & Joshua" framing? → **Joshua Coleman** (personal)
2. What's your current MRR? → Needed for milestone customization
3. Which charity partner first? → Needed for revenue allocation story
4. Do you have financial transparency review? → Needed for credibility

### Day 2-3: Community Research
**Time:** 3-4 hours

**Indie Hackers:**
```
[ ] Create account (https://www.indiehackers.com)
[ ] Complete profile (80% done, using strategy template)
[ ] Follow 10 top contributors
[ ] Read 25 discussions (take notes on tone, engagement patterns)
[ ] Identify 15 discussions to comment on
[ ] Save links to favorite discussions
[ ] Read community guidelines
[ ] Review top posts (what drives engagement?)
```

**Analysis to document:**
- What topics drive engagement? (Funding, scaling, tools, etc.)
- Who are the respected voices?
- What language resonates? (Technical vs. narrative)
- What posts get downvoted?
- What tone works?

### Day 4: Content Customization
**Time:** 2-3 hours

**Customize INDIE-HACKERS-PRODUCT-SHOWCASE.md:**
```
[ ] Replace [X] placeholders with your actual metrics
[ ] Add personal background (optional)
[ ] Include your actual team info
[ ] Verify smart contract address
[ ] Link to actual audit (if available)
[ ] Add real charity partner name
[ ] Confirm all numbers are accurate
```

**Customize INDIE-HACKERS-60-30-10-STORY.md:**
```
[ ] Replace founder salary scenarios with your actual situation
[ ] Add your personal journey
[ ] Include real financial details (transparent)
[ ] Verify all numbers (MRR, allocation amounts, runway)
[ ] Add team member quotes (if available)
```

### Day 5: Profile Setup (Final)
**Time:** 1 hour

**Create your Indie Hackers profile:**
```
[ ] Username: Joshua Coleman
[ ] Display name: Joshua Coleman (Founder, FOR THE KIDS)
[ ] Bio: Copy from INDIE-HACKERS-STRATEGY.md Part 1
[ ] Profile image: Professional headshot
[ ] Tagline: Pick from 5 options (see strategy doc)
[ ] Links: Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn, Website
[ ] Keywords: AI, Solidity, Base Chain, Profit Allocation, etc.
[ ] Bio links: https://aidoesitall.website, contract address
```

**Profile review checklist:**
- Does it clearly explain the 60/30/10 model?
- Does it lead with tech, not charity angle?
- Are all links working?
- Is the tone authentic and specific?
- Does it invite technical review?

### Day 6-7: Pre-Comment Preparation
**Time:** 2 hours

**Write 5 pre-planned comments:**
```
[ ] Comment for "How to fund your startup" discussion
[ ] Comment for "Business model questions" discussion
[ ] Comment for "Building in public" discussion
[ ] Comment for "DAO governance" discussion
[ ] Comment for "AI infrastructure costs" discussion
```

**For each comment:**
- [ ] Write full comment (don't post yet)
- [ ] Proofread for tone
- [ ] Ensure it adds value (not self-promotional)
- [ ] Verify links work
- [ ] Save to document (for posting later)

## Keys to Success

1. **Start before you're ready** (don't wait for perfect metrics)
2. **Be specific** (numbers, not vibes)
3. **Respond quickly** (Tier 1 in 2 hours shows respect)
4. **Engage genuinely** (not just self-promotion)
5. **Admit uncertainty** ("We don't know yet" builds trust)
6. **Update regularly** (stale info kills credibility)
7. **Invite verification** (smart contract address, Basescan links)
8. **Focus on builders** (respect > sentiment)
9. **Keep the commitment** (60/30/10 allocation real)
10. **Be vulnerable** (mistakes, learnings, challenges)

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Posting all 5 milestones at once** → Spread over 12 months
2. **Overselling the ethical angle** → Lead with tech
3. **Responding slow to criticism** → Tier 1 = under 2 hours
4. **Hiding bad metrics** → Builders respect honesty
5. **Using crypto jargon unnecessarily** → Be accessible
6. **Ignoring community feedback** → Adjust based on response
7. **Going silent between posts** → Engagement = consistency
8. **Making promises you can't keep** → Only structural commitments
9. **Focusing only on your posts** → Engage others' discussions
10. **Treating it as short-term marketing** → Build for years

## Template: First Post Response Script

**For technical question:**
```
Great question about [specific technical point].

Here's how we solved it: [specific technical answer]

The constraint that forced this: [explain why it matters]

You can verify this in the code: [link to Basescan/GitHub]

Do you see any gaps in this approach?
```

**For skepticism:**
```
Fair concern about [specific concern].

Here's why it works: [mechanism, not sentiment]

You can verify: [links to proof - contract, audit, charity confirmation]

What would make you trust this more?
```

**For partnership inquiry:**
```
Absolutely interested in [specific aspect of partnership].

This isn't the right place for detailed discussion though.

Let's take this offline: [your email]

Looking forward to exploring this.
