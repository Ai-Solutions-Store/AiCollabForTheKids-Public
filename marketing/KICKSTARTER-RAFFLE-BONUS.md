## RAFFLE TICKET SYSTEM (IMPLEMENTATION)

### Backend Logic

**When backer pledges:**
1. Kickstarter webhook triggers POST /api/kickstarter/pledge
2. Backend calculates raffle tickets based on pledge amount
3. Store in database:
   ```javascript
   {
     backerEmail: 'backer@example.com',
     backerName: 'John Doe',
     pledgeAmount: 99,
     pledgeId: 'KS12345678',
     raffleTickets: 10,
     ticketNumbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
   }
   ```

### Raffle Ticket Assignment

```javascript
// Pseudo-code for ticket allocation
function assignRaffleTickets(pledgeAmount) {
  let tickets = 0;

  if (pledgeAmount >= 5000) tickets = 500;
  else if (pledgeAmount >= 999) tickets = 100;
  else if (pledgeAmount >= 299) tickets = 30;
  else if (pledgeAmount >= 99) tickets = 10;
  else if (pledgeAmount >= 29) tickets = 3;
  else if (pledgeAmount >= 9) tickets = 1;

  return tickets;
}
```

### Winner Selection (Livestream Method)

**Equipment Needed:**
- YouTube Live setup (camera, mic, OBS)
- Computer with access to raffle database
- Blockchain randomness source (Chainlink VRF or random.org API)

**Process:**
1. Livestream on YouTube (scheduled 7 days after campaign close)
2. Display total backers, total tickets
3. Use random.org API to generate winning ticket number
4. Display winner on screen (name + email blurred for privacy)
5. Contact winner via Kickstarter message + email
6. Winner has 7 days to respond (or backup winner selected)

---

## MARKETING IMPACT

### Why This Works

**Psychological Triggers:**
1. **Scarcity:** Limited-time campaign (30 days)
2. **Urgency:** Higher pledges = more tickets = better odds
3. **Social Proof:** Everyone's entering (FOMO effect)
4. **Personal Story:** Sabertooth is a historical artifact
5. **Altruism:** Winner gets to choose charity for $1,000

**Conversion Boost:**
- Estimated 15-25% increase in pledge conversions
- Higher-tier pledges more attractive (more tickets)
- Shareability (people share raffle announcements)

### Storytelling Angle

**"The Machine That Started It All"**

This isn't just a used computer. This is the SABERTOOTH - the i7-4960X workstation where a recycling business owner gave an AI full admin access and said "build something that helps kids."

This is where Claude Opus 4.5 wrote the first line of Gospel V1.3 code.
This is where the 60/30/10 split was hardcoded.
This is where Joshua took 10% less so kids could get 10% more.

Now it can be yours. Signed. Certified. History.
