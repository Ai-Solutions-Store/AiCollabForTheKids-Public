Subject: Building Platforms Where 60% Goes to Kids

Hey,

We built something different.

Most founders keep 80-90% of revenue.
We keep 10%.

60% goes to verified pediatric charities.
30% funds operations.

It sounds crazy. But it works better.

Our 5,000+ subscribers agree.

Read why this model beats traditional startup economics:

## GOSPEL V1.3 ALLOCATION FOR GROWTH

**Example: If we earn $5,000 in Month 1 (before expenses)**

Gross Revenue: $5,000
Gospel Allocation:
- 60% ? Charities: $3,000
- 30% ? Operations: $1,500
- 10% ? Founder: $500

Operations ($1,500):
- Growth/paid ads: $1,000 (66%)
- Infrastructure/tools: $300 (20%)
- Reserves: $200 (14%)

**This means:**
- We reinvest growth budget into ads
- $1,000/month = 500+ new subscribers at $2 CPA
- Paid ads compounding with organic growth
- Still allocating 60% to charities (never compromised)
