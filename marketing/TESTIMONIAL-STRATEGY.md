## PART 7: BEFORE/AFTER STORY FORMAT

### Template: Personal Transformation Story

---

**HEADLINE:** How [CUSTOMER] Went From [FRUSTRATION] to [SUCCESS] Using FOR THE KIDS

**SUBHEADLINE:** And helped $[AMOUNT] reach pediatric charities in the process

---

**BEFORE (The Problem)**

**Visual:** Frustrated/stressed photo or illustration

**Narrative (200 words):**

Set the scene. Paint a vivid picture of their struggle:
- Daily frustrations
- Time wasted
- Opportunities lost
- Emotional toll
- Financial impact

*Write in first person when possible.*

**Example:**

"Every Monday morning, I dreaded the same routine. As a consultant, I spent 4-5 hours on each proposal—researching, writing, formatting. By Friday, I had maybe 2-3 solid proposals written. The rest of the week was admin work.

I watched potential clients move on to faster competitors. My calendar showed available slots, but I couldn't fill them because I was drowning in proposal work. I felt like I was choosing between serving existing clients well or growing my business. That's not a choice—that's a trap."

---

**THE TURNING POINT**

**Visual:** Light bulb or moment of clarity

**Narrative (150 words):**

- Discovery of FOR THE KIDS
- Initial skepticism or hope
- Decision to try
- First-time setup

**Example:**

"A colleague mentioned FOR THE KIDS at lunch. I was skeptical—I'd tried three proposal tools before. But something about it caught my attention: they allocate 60% of every dollar to pediatric charities. That meant if I invested in this tool, I'd be helping kids, not just growing my business.

I signed up for a free trial that afternoon. Within 20 minutes, I had my first proposal templated. Within an hour, I'd generated three complete proposals. I literally sat back in my chair and thought: 'This is different.'"

---

**AFTER (The Results)**

**Visual:** Confident/successful photo or celebration

**Metrics Section:**

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Hours per proposal | 4-5 hrs | 1 hr | -80% |
| Proposals written/month | 8-10 | 25+ | +160% |
| Proposal win rate | 45% | 70% | +25% |
| Monthly revenue | $20K | $55K | +175% |
| Free time reclaimed | 0 | 15 hrs/wk | Critical |

---

**Narrative (250 words):**

Walk through the results chronologically:
- Week 1 improvements
- Month 1 breakthroughs
- 3-month transformation
- Lasting impact

**Example:**

"Week 1 was mind-bending. I went from dreading Mondays to excited about them. Instead of 4-5 hours crafting proposals, I was spending 1 hour customizing templates. Suddenly, I had 15+ hours of my life back.

By the end of Month 1, I'd written 25 proposals—more than I'd written in the previous 2 months combined. And something unexpected happened: my win rate improved. Better proposals = happier clients = higher close rates.

Three months in, I'd landed six new clients worth a combined $52K in annual contracts. My monthly revenue jumped from $20K to $55K. That's not a marginal improvement—that's a business transformation.

But here's what I'm proudest of: in those three months, I contributed $3,300 in platform usage to FOR THE KIDS, which means $1,980 went directly to pediatric charities. I'm not just growing my business—I'm helping kids get treatment they need. That's the part that really sticks with me."

---

**THE RIPPLE EFFECT**

**Subheading:** Beyond the Numbers

**Narrative (200 words):**

Show the intangible benefits:
- Work-life balance improvements
- Team impact (if applicable)
- Client satisfaction increases
- Personal fulfillment
- Community impact
- How it changed their worldview

**Example:**

"The numbers are one thing, but the lifestyle change is another. I'm no longer stressed about proposal deadlines. I'm actually excited to reach out to potential clients because I know I can turn proposals around in hours instead of days.

My team noticed the change too. I'm less grumpy, more available, actually present during team meetings instead of distracted by admin work.

And the charitable impact? That resonates every single day. When I see that 60% of my investment goes to kids, it changes how I think about my business. This isn't just about me making money—it's about me being part of something bigger. My success directly helps children who are fighting for their lives.

I tell everyone: FOR THE KIDS isn't just better software. It's software with a mission that actually cares about doing good. And that matters to me."

---

**THE MOMENT THEY BECAME A BELIEVER**

**Subheading:** The Thing That Sealed It

**Narrative (150 words):**

The emotional turning point. The moment they went from user to advocate.

**Example:**

"The thing that sealed it for me was reading the impact report. I saw that quarterly, FOR THE KIDS publishes a blockchain-verified ledger showing exactly how much went to which charities. No fluff. No marketing spin. Just transparent numbers.

I saw that my contribution—along with thousands of other users—had funded 23 new beds in a pediatric oncology unit at Philadelphia Children's Hospital. Twenty-three beds. Each one potentially saving a child's life.

That's when I realized: I'm not just using great software. I'm part of a movement. And that changes everything."

---

**CALL TO ACTION**

**Narrative (100 words):**

Ask them what they'd tell others:

*"If you're struggling with [PROBLEM], you owe it to yourself to try FOR THE KIDS. But more importantly, if you care about doing good while growing your business, this is the alignment you've been looking for.*

*Start with the free trial. You'll know within the first hour if it's right for you. And when you use it, remember: 60% of what you pay goes directly to kids who need help. That's not a marketing tagline—it's our business model."*

## PART 8: IMPACT STORIES FROM BENEFICIARIES

### What Are Beneficiary Stories?

These are stories from the **pediatric charities and organizations** that receive FOR THE KIDS' 60% revenue allocation. They answer the question: "What happens when FOR THE KIDS users help kids?"

### Story Format: "Where Your Dollar Goes"

---

**HEADLINE:** How [CUSTOMER] contribution Helped [CHILD/PROGRAM]

**SUBHEADLINE:** A story of impact behind the 60%

---

**THE CHILD'S STORY (First person when possible)**

**Visual:** Photo of child (with permission), or illustration if privacy needed

**Narrative (300 words):**

Paint a vivid picture:
- Child's background
- Medical condition
- Challenges they face
- Family impact
- Before-FOR THE KIDS-support status

**Important:** Always get written permission from families
**Ethical guidelines:**
- Use real names only with consent
- Blur/anonymize if needed for privacy
- Show dignity and respect
- Avoid exploitation or pity
- Focus on resilience and hope

**Example:**

"Mia was diagnosed with leukemia when she was seven years old. Her parents, Maria and Diego, went from planning her future to fighting for her present.

The treatment is intense: chemotherapy, radiation, blood transfusions, and weeks at a time in the hospital. For Mia's mom, it meant taking leave from work. For Mia's dad, it meant choosing between staying with his sick daughter and paying bills.

Beyond the medical battle, there's the cost. Hospital parking. Meals away from home. Gas to drive 45 minutes for appointments. Medications not fully covered by insurance. Special foods Mia can eat during treatment. It adds up to thousands of dollars that families like Mia's simply don't have."

---

**THE MOMENT HELP ARRIVED (Second Act)**

**Visual:** Program/facility where help was given

**Narrative (250 words):**

- How FOR THE KIDS funding helped
- Specific program or intervention
- Immediate impact on child
- Family response

**Example:**

"Through FOR THE KIDS' partnership with Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Mia's family qualified for their Patient Financial Assistance Program. Thanks to contributions like yours, they waived $8,000 of Mia's out-of-pocket costs for follow-up care.

That $8,000 meant Maria could stay with Mia full-time without the family going into debt. It meant Mia's dad didn't have to work three jobs. It meant buying nutritious food for Mia's recovering immune system instead of choosing between food and medicine.

But it meant something else too: it meant Mia could focus on getting well instead of worrying about her parents' stress. That matters when you're seven years old fighting for your life."

---

**THE LARGER PROGRAM**

**Subheading:** How One contribution Multiplies

**Narrative (200 words):**

Show how the funding enables the program:
- Number of families helped
- Services provided
- Long-term outcomes
- Scalability

**Example:**

"Children's Hospital's Patient Financial Assistance Program served 447 families last year, erasing a combined $2.1 million in out-of-pocket costs. But that's just the financial piece. The program also includes:

- Mental health counseling for parents (because caregiver stress is real)
- Nutritionist consultations (recovering kids need specific diets)
- Social work support (navigating insurance, employment, schools)
- Peer support groups (other families who understand)

When families aren't drowning in debt, they're available to be present with their kids. That presence—that emotional stability—is actually part of the healing process."

---

**THE LONG-TERM IMPACT**

**Subheading:** Where Is [CHILD] Now?

**Narrative (150 words):**

Fast forward. Show results:
- Current status
- Ongoing journey
- Hope and resilience
- Return to normalcy (when applicable)

**Example:**

"Mia is now in remission. She's eleven, in sixth grade, obsessed with soccer and her little brother. She still has monthly checkups. She'll take anti-cancer medication for a couple more years. But she's planning for a future—talking about what she wants to be, where she wants to go to college.

Her mom returned to work. Her dad is back to one job. Her family is healing financially as well as medically.

'Without that help, I don't know what we would have done,' Maria told us recently. 'My daughter got her life back. That's priceless.'"

---

**THE CONNECTION BACK TO supporters**

**Subheading:** This Is Why We Do This

**Narrative (100 words):**

Close the loop. Connect FOR THE KIDS customer generosity to this specific outcome.

**Example:**

"Every time a FOR THE KIDS customer uses our platform, 60% of that investment comes here—to families like Mia's.

That customer might not know Mia's name. They might never meet her. But their commitment to using a platform with a mission meant that when Mia got sick, her family wasn't destroyed financially.

If you're a FOR THE KIDS customer reading this: thank you. You didn't just buy software. You helped save a kid's life."

---

**IMPACT BY THE NUMBERS**

**Visual:** Infographic or callout box

```
HOW YOUR $100 INVESTMENT HELPED MIA

$100 Spent on FOR THE KIDS platform
× 60% → Charity allocation
= $60 to Children's Hospital

$60 × 447 families in program
= Mia's share of support

Result: $8,000 cost waiver
+ Family stability restored
+ Full focus on healing
= One more kid's life changed
