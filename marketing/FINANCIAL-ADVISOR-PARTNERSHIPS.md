## FOR THE KIDS - Profit Allocation Through Trusted Advisors

**Campaign URL:** https://aidoesitall.website
**Mission:** 60% of all revenue allocated to Verified Pediatric Charities
**Version:** Gospel V1.3 Compliant
**Created:** December 16, 2025
**Audience:** Wealth Managers, CFPs, Financial Advisors, Robo-Advisor Platforms

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Financial advisors guide wealth decisions for high-net-worth clients. FOR THE KIDS transforms their practice into a **profit-allocation platform** where client transactions automatically allocate 60% of revenue to Verified Pediatric Charities.

This is not "charitable giving" — this is **structural revenue allocation** embedded in the business model. Financial advisors become architects of child wellness through normal business operations.

---

## 1. WEALTH MANAGER CHARITY ALLOCATION PROGRAM

### THE OPPORTUNITY

**Position:** "Allocate Client Wealth Strategically to Child Wellness"

Financial advisors manage investment portfolios, financial plans, and wealth transfers for HNW clients. FOR THE KIDS allows them to:

- **Direct a portion of advisory fees** through the platform's 60/30/10 split
- **Create family wealth transfer strategies** that include child-focused allocation
- **Build firm reputation** as profit-conscious AND impact-driven
- **Differentiate from competitors** who only talk about ESG/impact investing

### IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

**Tier 1 - Advisor Dashboard:**
- Integration with advisor CRM platforms (Salesforce, Black Diamond, Orion)
- Real-time allocation tracking: "Your team has allocated $47,302 to Verified Pediatric Charities this quarter"
- Client-facing reporting: "Your portfolio transactions helped X children this year"
- Automated quarterly impact statements for client portfolios

**Tier 2 - Client Facing:**
- White-labeled impact widgets on advisor websites
- "Your Financial Plan Supports Children's Health" badge/certification
- Quarterly client letters highlighting allocation impact
- Integration with financial planning software (MoneyGuidePro, Orion, eMoney)

**Tier 3 - Compliance:**
- SEC-compliant disclosures (allocation is part of advisory fee structure, not separate contribution)
- Form ADV updates for advisors offering FOR THE KIDS as service enhancement
- FINRA Rule 5210 compliance for advertising

### TALKING POINTS FOR ADVISORS

- "We allocate 60% of transaction revenue to child wellness — it's how we do business"
- "Your clients' wealth supports verified pediatric healthcare — automatically"
- "This is profit allocation, not contributions — it's embedded in our model"
- "Zero extra cost to clients — 60% comes from our revenue split"
