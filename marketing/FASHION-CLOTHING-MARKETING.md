1. **Sustainability** (environmental responsibility)
2. **Charity** (social responsibility)
3. **Quality** (personal value)

### Why Sustainability + Charity = Unbeatable Positioning

Modern consumers want to feel good about purchases. Sustainability alone doesn't address poverty. Charity alone lacks accountability. Combined? Unstoppable.

| Leather | Vegetable-tanned | No chrome chemicals | Leather Working Group |
| Synthetics | Bio-based | Plant-origin | USDA BioPreferred |

**Messaging:**
```
"Every FOR THE KIDS piece uses certified sustainable materials.
That means:
? 60% of your purchase helps kids (Gospel Revenue Split)
? 100% of materials are planet-positive
? 0% guilt about environmental impact
Wear well. Feel good. Help kids."
```

� Healthcare for her 3 kids
