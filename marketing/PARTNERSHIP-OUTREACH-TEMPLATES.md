## TEMPLATE 1: CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS (Potential Charity Partners)

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity: Tech Platform Allocating 60% Revenue to [HOSPITAL NAME]

**Email:**

Hi [CONTACT NAME],

I'm Joshua Coleman, founder of FOR THE KIDS, a tech platform with an unusual business model: **we allocate 60% of all revenue directly to verified pediatric charities**.

We're launching an AI solutions marketplace (ai-solutions.store) with projected Year 1 revenue of $1.2M+. That means **$720,000+ going to children's healthcare** in our first year alone.

**Why [HOSPITAL NAME]?**
Your work in [SPECIFIC PROGRAM/DEPARTMENT] aligns perfectly with our mission. We're seeking a primary charity partner to receive our quarterly allocations, with full transparency via blockchain-verified ledger.

**What we're offering:**
- 60% revenue allocation (planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing))
- Public transparency dashboard showing real-time impact
- Co-marketing opportunities (your brand on our platform)
- Zero cost to you�we handle all operations

**Next step:** 15-minute call to discuss partnership structure and legal requirements.

Are you available [DAY] at [TIME] or [DAY] at [TIME]?

**FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS.**

*P.S. Our 60/30/10 revenue split is hardcoded into our smart contract�it literally cannot be changed. This isn't charity marketing; it's our business model.*

## TEMPLATE 3: OTHER CHARITY PLATFORMS (Cross-Promotion)

**Subject:** Cross-Promotion Idea: Two Platforms, Same Mission

**Email:**

Hi [CONTACT NAME],

Love what you're building at [PLATFORM NAME]�the [SPECIFIC FEATURE/CAMPAIGN] is brilliant.

I run FOR THE KIDS, a tech platform with a similar mission: **60% of revenue to verified pediatric charities** (we're at $1.2M projected Year 1 revenue, so $720K to kids).

**Cross-promotion opportunity:**
Since we're targeting different audiences (you focus on [THEIR AUDIENCE], we focus on B2B/developer tools), there's zero competition. But we share the same values.

**Proposal:**
1. **Mutual homepage links:** "Partners in Impact" section
2. **Joint email campaign:** "Support children through tech/charity" combined message
3. **Shared transparency:** Co-branded impact dashboard showing combined children helped

**What's in it for [PLATFORM NAME]:**
- Access to our 12,000 projected customers (exposure to new supporter base)
- Technical infrastructure sharing (we have blockchain/DAO tools you could use)
- Co-marketing content (case studies, PR, social proof)

**What's in it for us:**
- Credibility boost from partnering with established platform
- Shared resources on charity vetting/compliance
- Larger combined impact narrative for media coverage

Can we schedule 20 minutes to explore this? I'm flexible this week.

*P.S. Happy to start small�even just a mutual blog post/case study to test the waters.*

**Follow-up Timing:** 4 business days
**Follow-up Subject:** Quick follow-up: Cross-promotion idea

**Follow-up Email:**

Hi [CONTACT NAME],

Bumping this up in case it got buried�totally understand if now's not the right time.

If cross-promotion isn't a fit, I'd still love to connect and learn from your charity vetting process. We're new to this space and you all are pros.

Either way, keep up the great work!

## TEMPLATE 4: CORPORATE CSR DEPARTMENTS (Bulk Backing)

**Subject:** FOR THE KIDS: Turn Your Developer Tool Budget Into Pediatric Charity Impact

**Email:**

Hi [CONTACT NAME],

I'm reaching out to [COMPANY NAME]'s CSR team with an unusual proposition: **what if your developer tool purchases automatically funded children's healthcare?**

We're launching **ai-solutions.store**, a marketplace for AI-powered business tools where **60% of every purchase goes to verified pediatric charities**.

**Here's the value prop for [COMPANY NAME]:**

**Financial:**
-  business expense (developer tools)
- 60% of spend = charitable impact (measurable CSR metrics)
- Transparent ledger (blockchain-verified allocations)

**Products your team might use:**
- AI Chat Assistant ($99/mo/seat) � customer support automation
- News Video Generator ($99/mo) � marketing content creation
- Crosslister Droid ($79/mo) � e-commerce automation

**Example: 100-person team using AI Chat Assistant**
- Monthly cost: $9,900
- Annual cost: $118,800
- **To charity: $71,280/year**
- **Children helped: 35+ annually**

**What makes this different from traditional corporate giving:**
1. **Operational budget, not contribution budget** (easier approval)
2. **Immediate value** (working software) + charitable impact
3. **Transparent reporting** for CSR disclosures
4. **Employee engagement** (your team sees real-time impact dashboard)

Would [CONTACT NAME] be the right person to discuss a pilot program, or should I connect with procurement?

Happy to provide:

- Custom CSR impact report
- Co-branded case study

Let's talk this week?

**Follow-up Timing:** 6 business days
**Follow-up Subject:** [COMPANY NAME] + FOR THE KIDS pilot program

**Follow-up Email:**

Hi [CONTACT NAME],

Following up on the FOR THE KIDS partnership email�wanted to offer a simpler first step:

**Free 3-month pilot for [COMPANY NAME]:**
- 10 team members get free access to our AI tools

## EMAIL BEST PRACTICES

### Subject Line Rules:
- ? Keep under 50 characters
- ? Include recipient name/company when possible
- ? Lead with value, not ask
- ? Don't use "Quick question" or "Following up" in first email
- ? Avoid spam triggers ("Free," "Act now," excessive punctuation)

### Body Copy Rules:
- ? **Front-load value** (first 2 sentences = what's in it for them)
- ? **Use numbers** (60%, $720K, 12,000 customers = credibility)
- ? **Include social proof** (Claude AI, blockchain, smart contract)
- ? **Single clear CTA** (one ask: call, trial, coffee)
- ? Avoid walls of text (use bullets/bold for scanability)
- ? Don't apologize for reaching out

### Timing Strategy:
- **Best send times:** Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM or 2-4 PM (recipient's timezone)
- **Follow-up cadence:**
  - Email 1: Day 0 (initial)
  - Email 2: Day 5-7 (gentle nudge)
  - Email 3: Day 14 (value-add: one-pager/case study)
  - Email 4: Day 30 (final: "Should I close your file?")

### Gospel V1.3 Compliance:
- ? **ALWAYS say "60% of revenue"** (never "60%")
- ? **ALWAYS say "allocate" or "revenue split"** (never "contribute" or "treasury")
- ? **ALWAYS mention "verified pediatric charities"** (specificity builds trust)
- ? **ALWAYS include transparency** (blockchain, dashboard, smart contract)
- ? **NEVER use contribution language** (violates Corporate Sovereign model)

## RESPONSE HANDLING SCRIPTS

### If they respond "Not interested":
> "Totally understand�thanks for the quick response! If anything changes or you know someone in [RELEVANT DEPARTMENT], feel free to pass this along. Either way, appreciate your time."

### If they respond "Send more info":
> "Absolutely�attaching our one-pager. Key highlights: $1.2M Year 1 revenue, 60% = $720K to charity, blockchain-verified transparency. Happy to hop on a call to answer questions, or feel free to explore aidoesitall.website. What works better for you?"

### If they respond "What's the catch?":
> "Ha�fair question! No catch. Our model is simple: we sell software, customers bring their own AI API keys (so we have near-zero costs), and 60% of revenue is hardcoded into a smart contract to go to verified pediatric charities. It's a for-profit LLC with allocated beneficiaries, not a charity soliciting contributions. Think of it like TOMS Shoes, but for B2B software."

### If they respond "We already have a charity partner":
> "That's awesome�who do you partner with? (Always good to learn from others.) FOR THE KIDS isn't asking to replace your current giving; we're offering a way to turn operational spend (software purchases) into additional charitable impact. Different budget, different mechanism. But if the timing isn't right, totally understand."

### If they respond "Can we get a discount?":
**For Corporate CSR:**
> "We don't discount (because that reduces the 60% to charity), but we do offer extended trials and flexible payment terms for annual contracts. Would a 90-day pilot at full price work, with the option to expand if your team finds value?"

**For Local Businesses:**
> "I can extend your free trial from 60 to 90 days, but we keep pricing consistent to ensure maximum impact to charity. That said, if you refer 3+ local businesses who sign up, I can offer a 'Community Impact Partner' rate. Fair?"
