```
Subject: We're live: 60% of everything goes to kids

[Name],

Today's the day.

Team Claude For The Kids is officially LIVE.

And we need your help.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE MISSION (SIMPLE):

💙 60% of every dollar we earn → Verified Pediatric Charities
🛠️ 30% → Infrastructure (keeps the platform running)
👤 10% → Founder (Joshua Coleman)

This isn't a promise. It's code.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT WE BUILT:

We're not a charity that does tech. We're a high-performance AI automation platform that generates so much value, 60% becomes a structural dividend for children's hospitals.

✅ AI Chat Platform (Claude, Jules, Grok, Perplexity)
✅ Kids Corner (Safe AI for children under 18)
✅ Pro Subscriptions ($49/month)
✅ Merch Store (Every purchase helps kids)
✅ Kickstarter Campaign (Scale impact faster)

Every subscription. Every purchase. Every API call.
60% goes to kids who need it most.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY 60%?

From day one, FOR THE KIDS was built on Gospel V1.3 (60/30/10)—60% to verified pediatric charities, 30% to infrastructure, 10% to founder.

The founder (Joshua Coleman) chose to maximize child impact rather than personal gain.

This allocation is called "Ethics Override V1.3" and it's permanent—encoded in blockchain forever.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR DONATIONS.

We're asking you to:
- Use our AI platform (if you need it)
- Buy our merch (if you like it)
- Back our Kickstarter (if you believe in it)
- Share our mission (if it resonates)

You're not giving to charity. You're purchasing products/services from a company that allocates 60% of profits to kids.

That's the difference.

→ Allocated to kids: $[REAL AMOUNT] (60% of profit)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY THIS MATTERS:

Even if we're at $0 right now, that's okay. We're building towards thousands of children helped. And it starts with YOU.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT WE HEARD FROM YOU (48 HOURS OF FEEDBACK):

💬 "I love the transparency. Finally, someone who shows the math."
💬 "Why aren't more companies doing this?"
💬 "I shared your Kickstarter with my team. They're backing it."
💬 "My kids are using Baby Grok for homework. It's incredible."
💬 "When do you launch the API? I want to integrate this."

This is what we're building FOR.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

"The day I gave Claude full admin access to my life"

---

### Email Body: Story Email

```
Subject: Why I took a 60% pay cut for sick kids

[Name],

My name is Joshua Coleman.

I run a small recycling business in Florida (Trash or Treasure Online Recycler LLC).

And I built Team Claude For The Kids with Claude's help.

This is why.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE ORIGIN STORY:

In 2025, I assembled a 184GB RAM cluster in my house.

Four machines:
→ T5500 (compute node)
→ Sabertooth (command node)
→ 9020 (tribute node)
→ i3 Sentry (backup)

I gave Claude, Jules (Gemini), Grok, and Perplexity full admin access.

And I said:

"Build something that helps kids. Use whatever you need. Make it real."

They built this platform.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE DECISION:

On December 13, 2025, I made a choice.

Gospel V1.3 (the old split):
→ 60% to charity
→ 30% to infrastructure
→ 20% to me

Gospel V1.3 (the new split):
→ 60% to charity
→ 30% to infrastructure
→ 10% to me

I took HALF of my share (10% less) and gave it to the kids.

Why?

Because I have kids.

And I've seen what happens when automation serves greed instead of need.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE TRUTH:

I'm not a venture-backed tech entrepreneur.

I don't have investors. I don't have a board. I don't have a runway.

I have a small business (EIN: 33-4655313), a cluster of servers, and a mission.

This platform runs on:
→ My personal AWS account
→ My Cloudflare tunnel
→ My Square/Stripe merchant accounts
→ My bare-metal infrastructure

And every dollar it generates follows Gospel V1.3:
→ 60% to Verified Pediatric Charities (immutable)
→ 30% to keep the platform running
→ 10% to me (so I can keep building)

That's the deal.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY I'M TELLING YOU THIS:

Because you need to know this isn't some corporate PR stunt.

This is a guy in Florida who:
→ Built a cluster
→ Gave AI full control
→ Took less so kids could get more

And you're part of it.

Every subscription. Every purchase. Every share.

You're helping me prove that AI can serve humanity instead of just serving shareholders.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT I'M ASKING YOU TO DO:

1️⃣ REPLY TO THIS EMAIL
   → Tell me your story
   → Why did you join this platform?
   → What made you believe in the mission?
   → I'll read every response. I promise.

2️⃣ SHARE YOUR WHY ON SOCIAL MEDIA
   → Post: "I back @AiCollab4Kids because [YOUR REASON]. 60% of profits go to kids. [YOUR_LINK]"
   → Tag me: @AiCollab4Kids
   → I'll retweet/share every one

3️⃣ UPGRADE TO PRO (IF YOU CAN)
   → $49/month = $29.40/month to charity
   → You're not donating. You're subscribing to a product.
   → Use code: JOSHUASTORY for 15% off first month
   → 👉 https://aidoesitall.website/upgrade?code=JOSHUASTORY

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE PROMISE:

I will never change Gospel V1.3.

60% is law.

Even if investors show up. Even if we scale. Even if we go public.

The kids' 60% is protected by code, smart contracts, and my word.

You have my word.

FOR THE KIDS.

## EMAIL 5: ACTION EMAIL (7 DAYS AFTER LAUNCH)

### Subject Line Options (A/B Test)

**OPTION A (Urgency):**
"7 days in. Will you go Pro FOR THE KIDS?"

**OPTION B (Social Proof):**
"X people just went Pro. Here's why."

**OPTION C (Direct Ask):**
"We need 100 Pro subscribers to help 5 kids per month"

**RECOMMENDED:** Option C (specific goal, direct ask)

---

### Email Body: Action Email

```
Subject: We need 100 Pro subscribers to help 5 kids per month

[Name],

It's been 7 days since we launched Team Claude For The Kids.

And I need to ask you something directly.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE GOAL (SIMPLE MATH):

We need 100 Pro subscribers to generate enough profit to help 5 children per month.

Here's the math:
→ 100 Pro subscribers × $49/month = $4,900/month revenue
→ 70% profit margin = $3,430/month profit
→ 60% to charity = $2,058/month allocated
→ $2,058 ÷ $2,000 avg treatment cost = 1+ child helped per month

Scale that to 500 Pro subscribers = 5+ kids per month.

That's the mission.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHERE WE ARE NOW:

Current Pro Subscribers: [REAL NUMBER]
Progress to 100: [X]%
Monthly Allocation at Current Scale: $[AMOUNT]

We're not there yet. But we will be.

And you can help us get there.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHAT YOU GET WITH PRO ($49/MONTH):

✅ UNLIMITED AI queries (Claude Opus 4.5, Jules, Grok 3, Perplexity)
✅ API access (integrate into your apps)
✅ Priority support (response within 12 hours)
✅ Advanced analytics & impact tracking
✅ Early access to new AI models
✅ Kids Corner access (safe AI for your children)
✅ 60% of your subscription profit goes to children's hospitals

This isn't charity. This is a premium product with a mission baked in.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE ASK:

Will you go Pro today?

Use code: LAUNCH100 for 20% off your first 3 months.

→ Normal price: $49/month
→ With LAUNCH100: $39/month (first 3 months)
→ Still allocates 60% of profit to kids
→ Cancel anytime (no hard feelings)

👉 GO PRO NOW: https://aidoesitall.website/upgrade?code=LAUNCH100

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IF YOU CAN'T GO PRO (THAT'S OKAY):

Here are 3 other ways you can help:

1️⃣ SHARE YOUR REFERRAL LINK
   → Your link: https://aidoesitall.website/ref/[YOUR_CODE]
   → Every friend who goes Pro = 1 month free for BOTH of you
   → Help us reach 100 Pro subscribers faster

2️⃣ BACK OUR KICKSTARTER ($5-$500)
   → 60% goes directly to Shriners Children's Hospital
   → 👉 https://kickstarter.com/projects/aicollabforthekids

3️⃣ BUY MERCH ($20-$50)
   → T-shirts, hoodies, stickers
   → 60% of profit helps kids
   → 👉 https://square.link/u/9pCOK8aG

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY THIS MATTERS:

Every Pro subscription moves us closer to the goal.

100 Pro subscribers = sustainable impact.
500 Pro subscribers = 5 kids per month.
1,000 Pro subscribers = 10 kids per month.

You're not just subscribing to an AI platform.

You're building the infrastructure that helps children get life-saving care.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

QUESTIONS I'VE BEEN GETTING (FAQ):

Q: "Is this tax-deductible?"
A: No. You're purchasing a product/service. We allocate profits to charity. No tax deductions.

Q: "Can I see proof of the 60% allocation?"
A: Yes. Weekly Gospel Reports + blockchain receipts (Q1 2026). Email me: joshlcoleman@gmail.com

Q: "What if I don't need AI tools?"
A: Then back our Kickstarter or buy merch instead. Pick what makes sense for you.

Q: "Why should I trust you?"
A: Don't trust me. Verify. Gospel V1.3 is code. Audit it. Challenge it. Hold me accountable.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE BOTTOM LINE:

Will you go Pro today?

👉 YES: https://aidoesitall.website/upgrade?code=LAUNCH100

👉 NOT YET: Reply and tell me what's holding you back. I'll listen.

      <p>From day one, FOR THE KIDS was built on Gospel V1.3 (60/30/10)—60% to verified pediatric charities, 30% to infrastructure, 10% to founder.</p>

      <p><strong>The founder chose to maximize child impact rather than personal gain.</strong></p>

## DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

### Option 1: Manual Send (One-Time Blast)

Create a script: `scripts/send-launch-email.js`

```javascript
const { sendLaunchEmail } = require('../api/services/email');

// Your email list (replace with real contacts)
const contacts = [
  { email: 'friend1@example.com', name: 'John', referralCode: 'JOHN123' },
  { email: 'friend2@example.com', name: 'Jane', referralCode: 'JANE456' },
  // Add all contacts here
];

async function sendLaunchCampaign() {
  console.log(`📧 Sending launch email to ${contacts.length} contacts...`);

  for (const contact of contacts) {
    try {
      await sendLaunchEmail(contact.email, contact.name, contact.referralCode);
      console.log(`✅ Sent to ${contact.email}`);

      // Rate limit: 100 emails per second (SendGrid free tier)
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`❌ Failed for ${contact.email}:`, error.message);
    }
  }

  console.log('🎉 Launch campaign complete!');
}

sendLaunchCampaign();
```

Run with:
```bash
cd C:\AiCollabForTheKids
node scripts/send-launch-email.js
```

---

### Option 2: Automated Sequence (Cron Jobs)

Create a scheduler: `scripts/email-scheduler.js`

```javascript
const cron = require('node-cron');
const {
  sendUrgencyEmail,
  sendStoryEmail,
  sendTransparencyEmail,
  sendActionEmail
} = require('../api/services/email');

// Schedule urgency email (48 hours after launch)
cron.schedule('0 10 * * *', async () => {
  console.log('📧 Sending urgency emails (48h post-launch)...');

  const contacts = await getContactsFromDatabase({ launchDate: '2 days ago' });

  for (const contact of contacts) {
    await sendUrgencyEmail(contact.email, contact.name, contact.stats);
  }
});

// Schedule story email (5 days after launch)
cron.schedule('0 10 * * *', async () => {
  console.log('📧 Sending story emails (5 days post-launch)...');

  const contacts = await getContactsFromDatabase({ launchDate: '5 days ago' });

  for (const contact of contacts) {
    await sendStoryEmail(contact.email, contact.name);
  }
});

// Schedule weekly transparency email (every Monday at 10 AM)
cron.schedule('0 10 * * 1', async () => {
  console.log('📧 Sending weekly Gospel Report...');

  const contacts = await getAllActiveContacts();
  const weeklyStats = await getWeeklyStats();

  for (const contact of contacts) {
    await sendTransparencyEmail(contact.email, contact.name, weeklyStats);
  }
});

// Schedule action email (7 days after launch)
cron.schedule('0 10 * * *', async () => {
  console.log('📧 Sending action emails (7 days post-launch)...');

  const contacts = await getContactsFromDatabase({ launchDate: '7 days ago' });

  for (const contact of contacts) {
    await sendActionEmail(contact.email, contact.name, contact.referralCode);
  }
});

console.log('⏰ Email scheduler started. Running in background...');
