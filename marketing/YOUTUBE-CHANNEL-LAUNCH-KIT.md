**Video Description:**

```
In December 2025, I did something most entrepreneurs would call insane. I told Claude AI to build a company that gives away 60% of its profits. And then I made that split immutable. Unchangeable. Forever.

WATCH THIS IF:
- You're interested in how mission-driven AI platforms are built
- You want to see the founder journey of an unconventional startup
- You care about transparent, verifiable business models
- You're curious about using AI as a co-builder

WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
- Why I decided to give away 60% of profits before the company even launched
- How I assembled an AI Board of Directors (Claude, Jules, Grok, Perplexity)
- How the Gospel V1.3 mission directive was created
- Why the 60/30/10 split is hardcoded into a smart contract (and can't be changed)
- The real infrastructure cost of running this platform ($0 in VC funding)

ABOUT FOR THE KIDS:
This is the journey of building FOR THE KIDS - an AI platform where 60% of revenue goes to Verified Pediatric Charities via an planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing). It's not a charity. It's a for-profit LLC. But our profit goes where it should - to kids who need it.

REVENUE SPLIT BREAKDOWN:
60% ? Verified Pediatric Charities (Partner EIN pending)
30% ? Infrastructure (servers, APIs, development)
10% ? Founder (yes, I took a pay cut)

2. Webhook hits Node.js backend
3. Backend validates transaction
4. Database records: Transaction ID, amount, customer
5. 60/30/10 calculation happens (math is fast)
6. Smart contract records allocation on Base blockchain
7. Email sent with BaseScan link
8. Customer can immediately verify on blockchain

REAL-TIME STATS:
- Current Uptime: [X days]
- Transactions Today: [X]
- 60% to Charity Today: $[X]

- Uniqueness: No confusing similarity to competitor thumbnails
- Consistency: All thumbnails use the same 3-color accent combo
- Faces: Include when possible (increases CTR 30%+)
- Numbers: "60%", "184GB", "thousands" - these are visual hooks
- Avoid: Stock photos, generic images, low-contrast text
- Consistency check: Lay out 5 thumbnails in a grid - do they feel cohesive?

**Thumbnail Creation Workflow:**
1. Design in Figma using the brand template system
2. Export as 1280x720px PNG (maximum quality)
3. Review on mobile (most viewers use phones)
4. Compare side-by-side with top competitors
5. Test readability by shrinking to small size
6. Upload to YouTube Studio with same branding across all videos
7. A/B test if CTR drops below 4% (redesign thumbnail)

- Aspect Ratio: 16:9 for long-form, 9:16 for Shorts

**Voiceover Guidelines:**
- Speaker: Clear, measured pace (not rushing)
- Audio levels: -3dB to -6dB peak (leave headroom)
- Music: Royalty-free, mission-appropriate (not overly cheerful)
- Silence: Use strategic pauses (3-5 seconds) between major points
- Equalization: Warm tone (not overly compressed)

**Opening Hook (First 15 seconds):**
- Hook must appear within first 3 seconds
- Voiceover hook + text overlay (redundancy for accessibility)
- Must answer: "Why should I keep watching?"
- No intro credits, animations, or sponsor reads

**Visual Style:**
- B-roll: Real hardware, actual transactions, genuine environment
- Graphics: Minimize stock footage; use original code/interface screenshots
- Animations: Subtle, purpose-driven (not flashy/distracting)
- Text overlays: Brand colors, readable fonts, 3-second minimum display
- Transitions: Clean cuts or simple fades (no spinning/sliding)

**Audio Production:**
- Music: Low volume (under -18dB) to not overpower voiceover
- Voiceover: -6dB to -3dB (louder and clearer than music)
- Sound effects: Minimal, mission-appropriate (blockchain "ding", transaction "beep")
- Silence: 1-2 second pauses between major sections
- No background noise (quiet recording environment)

**Captions & Accessibility:**
- Hard-code captions in all videos (YouTube auto-generate has issues)
- Captions must be 100% accurate (not auto-generated)
- Display time: 3+ seconds per caption (readability)
- Font: White text with dark background for contrast
- Include text on screen for important stats/quotes

**End Screen & Cards (YouTube Features):**
- End screen (last 20 seconds): Promote next video or subscribe button
- Cards (mid-video): Link to related content, BaseScan, website
- CTA text: "Subscribe to see more mission-driven AI content"
- Never disable end screens (they boost watch time)

**Title Card Requirements:**
- Display for 3+ seconds
- Brand colors (Gospel palette)
- Include: Video title, "FOR THE KIDS" logo

### Content Sequencing Logic

**Why this order matters:**

**Week 1 - Explainer First:**
- Establishes the core concept (60% to charity)
- Builds credibility with straightforward mission explanation
- Gives viewers foundation for subsequent videos

**Week 2 - Founder Story Second:**
- Humanizes the mission (not just an algorithm)
- Builds trust through transparency
- Shows the "why" behind the platform

**Week 3 - Tutorial Third:**
- Converts interest into action (how to subscribe)
- Provides clear next step
- Reduces friction for potential customers

**Week 4 - Impact & Shorts:**
- Consolidates learnings from first 3 weeks
- Shows real numbers/impact
- Keeps momentum with more short-form content

---

### Contingency Schedule

**If you miss a scheduled upload:**

- **Monday long-form missed?** ? Upload Tuesday 3pm EST (announce delay in community post)
- **Wednesday Short missed?** ? Upload Thursday 12pm EST (acknowledge in next scheduled post)
- **Friday community post missed?** ? Post over weekend (don't skip)
- **Sunday analytics review missed?** ? Complete by Monday 9am EST (before next upload)

**Never:**
- Go more than 7 days without publishing something
- Skip analytics review (data-driven iteration is crucial)
- Upload without monitoring first 24-hour performance
