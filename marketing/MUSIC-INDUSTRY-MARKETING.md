[CHORUS]
Sixty percent, that's the mission
Help kids live with precision
Music moves me, music moves us
Together we can be trusted
For the kids, for the kids
That's the only rhythm that fits

[VERSE 2]
Label said, "Keep it personal, keep it small"
But I'm thinking bigger, I'm risking it all
'Cause every stream could be a treatment
Every playlist could be a lifeline

[CHORUS]
Sixty percent, that's the mission
Help kids live with precision
Music moves me, music moves us
Together we can be trusted
For the kids, for the kids
That's the only rhythm that fits

[BRIDGE]
Don't make me choose between success and meaning
Don't make me choose between profit and people
I want both, and I know that's possible
Sixty percent, that's the proof

## CONCLUSION: MUSIC MOVES PEOPLE TO ACTION

This comprehensive music industry marketing strategy positions FOR THE KIDS at the intersection of music and social impact�two forces that fundamentally move people.

**Why Music Works:**

1. **Emotional Resonance:** Music reaches hearts before minds. Gospel-compliant messaging embedded in songs, videos, and artist stories creates deeper engagement than traditional marketing.

2. **Influencer Multiplier:** 50 musicians with 200M+ combined reach amplify our message to their most loyal fans�people already primed to action.

3. **Cultural Positioning:** We're not just selling AI tools. We're positioning FOR THE KIDS as a cultural movement where music fans can support kids while enjoying the artists they love.

4. **Gospel V1.3 Alignment:** Every partnership, every event, every dollar of revenue follows the immutable 60/30/10 split. Artists see real impact reporting�their fans' subscriptions genuinely helped kids.

5. **Perpetual Amplification:** Streaming playlists, music videos, and producer collaborations create permanent, renewable revenue streams. Each new stream helps more kids.

**The Movement:**

Musicians for Kids isn't a campaign. It's a movement. And movements are built on shared purpose, not marketing spend.

By 2026, we want 100+ musicians globally known for their FOR THE KIDS partnership. We want playlists with millions of followers. We want music videos viewed by hundreds of millions. We want kids at pediatric charities to know their treatment was funded by fans listening to their favorite songs.

**The Gospel:**

60% of all revenue goes to Verified Pediatric Charities. This is immutable. This is the promise we make to every artist, every fan, every child.

Music moves people to action. Let's move them toward kids' health.
