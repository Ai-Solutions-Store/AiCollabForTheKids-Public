## GOOGLE SHEETS FORMULAS (COPY/PASTE)

### Calculate Open Rate:
```
=COUNTIF(K:K,"Yes")/COUNTA(I:I)
```
(Assuming Column K = "Opened?", Column I = "Date Sent Email 1")

### Calculate Response Rate:
```
=COUNTA(P:P)/COUNTA(I:I)
```
(Assuming Column P = "Response Date", Column I = "Date Sent Email 1")

### Calculate Total Charity Impact:
```
=SUM(U:U)
```
(Assuming Column U = "Charity Impact (Est)")

### Count by Status:
```
=COUNTIF(A:A,"Partner")
```
(Assuming Column A = "Status")

### Days Since Last Contact:
```
=TODAY()-I2
```
(Assuming Column I = "Date Sent Email 1", Row 2 = first data row)

### Conditional Formatting Rules:

**Status Column:**
- "Partner" = Green fill
- "Meeting Booked" = Yellow fill
- "Dead" = Red fill
- "Cold" = Gray fill

**Next Action Date Column:**
- If date is in the past = Red text (overdue)
- If date is today = Bold text (due today)
- If date is within 3 days = Orange text (upcoming)

**Priority Column:**
- "High" = Red text, bold
- "Medium" = Orange text
- "Low" = Gray text

## EXPORT TO CRM (HUBSPOT/SALESFORCE)

If you decide to use a CRM instead of Google Sheets:

- **Streak (Gmail Plugin, Free):** CRM inside Gmail, great for small teams

### Data to Import:
1. Contact Name, Email, Phone, Company
2. Deal Value, Deal Stage (maps to "Status")
3. Custom fields: Category, Priority, UTM Campaign, Tags
4. Activity history: Email sends, opens, responses, meetings

### Integration Benefits:
- Auto-track email opens/clicks (no manual updates)
- Set up automated follow-up sequences
- Mobile app for on-the-go updates
- Team collaboration (if you hire BD help)
