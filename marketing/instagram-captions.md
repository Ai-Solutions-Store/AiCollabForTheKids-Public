## POST 1: EDUCATIONAL - The 60/30/10 Split

**Caption:**
What if charity platforms were built differently?

Most platforms take 5-10% off the top. We're doing the opposite.

60% goes directly to verified pediatric charities
30% maintains the platform infrastructure
10% to the founder (who chose to take LESS so kids get MORE)

This isn't just a donation platform. It's a movement backed by blockchain transparency, AI automation, and a community that believes kids deserve better.

Our Kickstarter launches soon. Early backers get exclusive NFTs, governance tokens, and the chance to shape a platform that puts children first.

## POST 2: EMOTIONAL - The Why Behind It All

**Caption:**
Every child deserves a fighting chance.

Cancer doesn't care about your zip code. Neither does hunger, homelessness, or lack of access to healthcare.

That's why we built FOR THE KIDS - a platform where 60% of every dollar goes directly to verified pediatric charities. Not 50%. Not "most of it." SIXTY PERCENT. Guaranteed. Transparent. Traceable.

We've spent over 14 hours auditing every line of code to ensure this promise is kept. Because when it comes to kids, there's no room for error.

This isn't about us. It's about the single mom who can't afford treatment. The kid who goes to bed hungry. The teenager aging out of foster care.

Our Kickstarter launches soon. Be part of something bigger than yourself.

## POST 4: EDUCATIONAL - How Blockchain Changes Charity

**Caption:**
"Where does my donation actually go?"

If you've ever asked this question, blockchain is the answer.

Every transaction on FOR THE KIDS is recorded on an immutable ledger. You can trace your donation from wallet to charity wallet in real-time.

No middlemen. No hidden fees. No wondering.

Smart contracts automatically split funds: 60% to charity, 30% to infrastructure, 10% to founder. It happens instantly, and everyone can verify it.

This is what transparency looks like in 2025.

Our Kickstarter launches soon. Early backers get governance tokens to vote on platform decisions.

Ready to see charity done right?
