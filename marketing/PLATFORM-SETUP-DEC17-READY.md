```markdown
# What is FOR THE KIDS?

FOR THE KIDS is a platform that builds AI-powered products where **60% of all revenue goes directly to verified pediatric charities.**

## The Mission
Every product we create—AI assistants, educational tools, merchandise, subscriptions—is designed to generate revenue that helps kids.

## The Split (Gospel V1.3)
- **60%** → Verified Pediatric Charities
- **30%** → Infrastructure, hosting, development
- **10%** → Founder (Joshua Coleman)

## Why This Matters
Most companies donate 1-5% of profits (after expenses). We allocate **60% of gross revenue** before anyone gets paid.

The founder took LESS (10% instead of 20% in V1.2) so kids get MORE.

## Products
1. **DROID AI** - Intelligent assistant
2. **Kids Corner** - Educational AI
3. **DAO Platform** - Community governance
4. **Merch Store** - Apparel & goods
5. **Premium Subscriptions** - Advanced features

## Transparency
All charity distributions are public, auditable, and immutable.

# Gospel V1.3 - The Immutable Law

Gospel V1.3 is the ethical foundation of FOR THE KIDS. It cannot be changed.

## The Split
```
60% → Verified Pediatric Charities
30% → Infrastructure & Growth
10% → Founder
```

## Evolution
- **V1.0:** Initial concept (50/30/20)
- **V1.2:** Refined (50/30/20)
- **V1.3:** Ethics Override (60/30/10) ← CURRENT

On December 13, 2025, Founder Joshua Coleman moved 10% from his allocation to the charity allocation.

**"Kids deserve more than I do."** - Joshua Coleman

## Why "Gospel"?
Because this is our sacred truth. Unchangeable. Non-negotiable.

## Enforcement
The 60/30/10 split is:
- Hardcoded in smart contracts
- Audited monthly
- Publicly transparent
- Immutable by design

No board, investor, or acquisition can change this.

## Verification
All charities must be:
1. 501(c)(3) verified
2. Pediatric-focused
3. Highly-rated (Charity Navigator, GuideStar)
4. Approved by DAO vote (when active)

# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

**Q: Is this real? 60% seems too good to be true.**
A: It's real. Check our transparency dashboard, smart contracts, and monthly reports. Everything is public.

A: No. Gospel V1.3 is immutable. Even if the founder wanted to change it, the smart contracts won't allow it.

A: The 60/30/10 split is in the contracts. Any acquirer must honor it or the platform shuts down.
