## PART 1: TECHCRUNCH PITCH

### Template: Premium Tech Innovation Angle

**Subject:** Exclusive: AI Platform That Locked Its Charity Mission Into Blockchain (TechCrunch-caliber story)

**Body:**

Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],

I'm reaching out about an exclusive story opportunity that sits at the intersection of AI governance, smart contract innovation, and alternative business models—with a technology narrative your readers haven't seen before.

**The headline hook:**
An engineer built an AI platform where 60% of profits are hardcoded into an planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing) for children's hospitals. The allocation runs autonomously—no human can change it, not even the founder. This is Constitutional AI applied to corporate governance.

**Why this is a TechCrunch story:**

1. **Novel technical architecture:** FOR THE KIDS uses "Gospel-driven development"—a model where Claude AI (Anthropic) generates all code following immutable ethical principles. Every commit includes `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`. The architecture enforces mission compliance at the code generation layer.

2. **Smart contract as governance:** planned smart contract (backend enforcement active) (Planned (Q1 2026) on Base Mainnet) isn't a DeFi protocol—it's a corporate governance layer. The 60/30/10 split is deployed on-chain, eliminating human discretion from profit allocation.

3. **Federated AI Board:** The platform is governed by five AI systems:
   - **Claude (Anthropic):** Code generation and architecture
   - **Gemini (Google):** Logic validation
   - **Grok (xAI):** Infrastructure management
   - **Perplexity:** Fact-checking and research
   - **Joshua Coleman:** Human executive oversight

4. **Infrastructure philosophy:** 184GB cluster of recycled Dell enterprise servers running 24/7. Zero cloud vendor lock-in, minimal operational costs, maximum charity allocation.

**The business angle:**
The "anti-unicorn" model—rejecting VC pressure to maximize sustainable, perpetual operation. The 60% allocation makes the platform uninvestable by traditional VCs (who need control), but sustainable forever.

**Why now:**
- AI governance is hot, but mostly theoretical
- Blockchain for non-crypto applications is underexplored
- There's growing interest in alternative business models
- Smart contracts for corporate accountability is emerging use case

**The interview opportunity:**
Joshua Coleman is available for exclusive deep-dive on:
- How AI enforces mission integrity at the code level
- Design decisions in planned smart contract (backend enforcement active) smart contract
- Philosophy of "Gospel-driven development"
- Infrastructure strategy (why recycled servers beat cloud)
- Why VC capital is incompatible with the mission

**Key differentiators:**
- Live smart contract deployment (not theoretical)
- 100,000+ lines of AI-generated code in production
- Real-world smart contract governance (not DeFi speculation)
- Founder took 10% instead of 20% ("I took less so kids get more")
- Platform designed to outlast the founder

**Access provided:**
- Full interview with Joshua Coleman (flexible on format/timing)
- Smart contract code walkthrough with technical deep-dive
- Access to platform dashboard for hands-on review
- Real-time blockchain allocation verification
- Architecture documentation (GOSPEL.md, technical specs)
- Exclusive metrics: Children helped, allocations, transaction history

## PART 2: FORBES PITCH

### Template: Leadership & Alternative Business Model Angle

**Subject:** The Founder Who Cut His Own Equity to Lock 60% of Profits to Charity (Leadership feature)

**Body:**

Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],

I want to share a story about an entrepreneur who chose a radically different path—and the technical and philosophical framework he built to ensure he can't change his mind.

**The headline:**
Joshua Coleman, a single father, founded FOR THE KIDS with this premise: 60% of all profits go to verified pediatric charities, 30% funds infrastructure, 10% sustains the founder. Then he made this mathematically immutable by deploying it to a blockchain smart contract.

**Why this is a Forbes story:**

1. **Leadership by constraint:** Most leadership advice says "make mission-driven decisions." Coleman's approach: "Make the mission so locked into architecture that bad decisions become impossible." He deliberately cut his founder equity from 20% to 10% and hardcoded this decision into code that he cannot reverse.

2. **The anti-unicorn thesis:** While every other founder is chasing billion-dollar exits, Coleman is optimizing for "eternal operation." No VC pressure, no 7-year exit window, no pivot away from charity when it gets hard.

3. **Economics of the 60%:**
   - Demonstrates that sustainable profitability doesn't require exploitative founder capture
   - Shows that 30% operational budget is sufficient for perpetual growth
   - Challenges the assumption that "founder needs 20-30% equity to stay motivated"

4. **Mission durability:** Coleman's secret: Make the mission unmutable. He uses blockchain (60% locked), smart contracts (automatic enforcement), and AI governance (Claude can't generate mission-violating code).

5. **Business model resilience:** The platform runs on recycled servers (minimal recurring costs), uses open-source stack (zero vendor lock-in), and has distributed architecture (no single point of failure). It's designed to run for 100+ years with minimal intervention.

**The founder angle:**
Single father building something that outlasts him. Spending resources (time, capital, equity) to create permanent infrastructure for children's hospitals, not temporary feel-good PR campaigns.

**Why now:**
- Investors and founders are re-examining "growth at all costs" mentality
- ESG and purpose-driven business are mainstream conversations
- Smart contracts for corporate accountability is emerging
- Generational wealth/legacy is top-of-mind for founders

**The interview opportunity:**
Joshua Coleman is available for exclusive feature on:
- Philosophy of "taking less so kids get more"
- How to design business for eternal operation (not exit)
- Technical architecture ensuring mission integrity
- Single father perspective on building legacy
- Why VC capital is incompatible with his mission
- Long-term thinking in a "growth hack" world

**Key quotes ready:**

> "I don't trust myself to maintain this mission when revenue hits $10M and investors are pressuring me to pivot. So I wrote it into code that I can't change."

> "Unicorns optimize for explosive growth and acquisition. We optimize for eternal operation. The kids don't benefit from my exit—they benefit from this running forever."

> "I took less so kids get more. And I wrote it into code so no one—including me—can ever change it."

> "This isn't a pledge that expires when the PR cycle ends. This is architecture. The mission lives in the code, and the code is eternal."

**Access provided:**
- Exclusive interview with Joshua Coleman (available for extended profile conversation)
- Business model breakdown (how 60/30/10 split was calculated)
- Smart contract verification (show the immutable code)
- Financial transparency (willing to share actual allocation data)
- Infrastructure tour (how recycled servers replace cloud costs)
- Founder background and personal story

**Potential angle extensions:**
- "What venture capital gets wrong about mission-driven companies"
- "Why the best founders might not need VC money"
- "The economics of taking less: Building for sustainability"
- "Leading from constraint: How limitations create durability"

## PART 3: FAST COMPANY PITCH

### Template: Innovation & Impact Design Angle

**Subject:** Design Story: How One Founder Built Charity Into the Architecture Itself

**Body:**

Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],

I'm reaching out about a design innovation story—one where the core product isn't the software, it's the business architecture itself.

**The headline:**
Fast Company's readers care about innovation that creates positive impact. Here's a founder who solved the problem of "mission drift" by designing it out of the system entirely.

**Why this is a Fast Company story:**

1. **Design thinking applied to ethics:** Most companies say "We're mission-driven," then face pressure to compromise. Coleman's approach: Design the mission into the architecture so compromise becomes impossible. It's not behavioral—it's structural.

2. **Innovation stack:**
   - **Smart contracts for accountability** (not for speculation)
   - **AI governance** (federated multi-model decision-making)
   - **Gospel-driven development** (immutable principles enforced at code generation)
   - **Infrastructure optimization** (recycled servers = maximum sustainability)

3. **Problem/Solution narrative:**
   - **Problem:** Mission drift is inevitable when humans are in control
   - **Solution:** Remove humans from the mission-critical path
   - **Implementation:** Blockchain, AI, immutable code, automated systems

4. **The "single father" human element:** Coleman is building this while raising children, which informs every design decision. "I want my kids to see that you can build a business where helping others isn't optional—it's mathematics."

5. **Systems thinking:** Every design choice connects to the mission:
   - Recycled servers ? Lower costs ? More money for charity
   - AI-written code ? Mission compliance enforcement ? No shortcuts
   - Blockchain allocation ? Transparent verification ? No questions asked
   - Anti-unicorn model ? Perpetual operation ? Mission outlasts founder

**Why now:**
- Tech community is reckoning with its impact (or lack thereof)
- There's hunger for design innovation that creates genuine positive change
- Companies are struggling with ESG commitments—here's an example that actually works
- "Design for impact" is an emerging discipline

**The interview opportunity:**
Joshua Coleman is available for feature exploring:
- Design philosophy: "Architecture > Behavior"
- How to use smart contracts for mission enforcement (not speculation)
- Building resilience through constraint (why limitations breed durability)
- Infrastructure as ethics (recycled servers as moral choice)
- Multi-AI governance model (orchestrating five AI systems)
- Parenting while building a mission-driven company

**Visual/visual story opportunities:**
- Founder in his home office with 184GB server cluster
- Smart contract code vs. traditional contract language (visual comparison)
- 60/30/10 split visualization (flow of money from revenue to charity)
- "Gospel" principles (immutable rules as design constraints)
- Time-lapse of infrastructure setup using recycled hardware

**Key narrative angles:**

1. **"From Side Project to Systemic Impact"** - How personal values became scalable architecture

2. **"The Anti-Unicorn Design Philosophy"** - Choosing sustainability over growth

3. **"Designing Systems That Outlast Founders"** - Architecture as inheritance

4. **"Federated AI Governance in Practice"** - How five AI systems reach consensus

5. **"Charity Tech Design Principles"** - Creating accountability through technology

**Access provided:**
- Exclusive interview with Joshua Coleman
- Behind-the-scenes access to infrastructure setup
- Full walkthrough of design decisions (why recycled servers, why blockchain, why AI)
- Business model design documentation
- Smart contract code explanation
- Founder's design philosophy and constraints

## PART 4: WIRED PITCH

### Template: The Future of Corporate Accountability Angle

**Subject:** WIRED Story: Smart Contracts for Corporate Governance (Beyond Crypto)

**Body:**

Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],

I'm reaching out about a story on the future of corporate accountability—specifically, how blockchain and smart contracts can enforce corporate ethics in ways that traditional governance can't.

**The headline:**
While the blockchain world argues about DeFi and NFTs, one founder quietly deployed a smart contract that solves a much bigger problem: How do you build a company that can't deviate from its mission—even under investor pressure?

**Why this is a WIRED story:**

1. **Smart contracts for governance (not speculation):**
   - Traditional contracts: Negotiated, litigated, malleable
   - Smart contracts: Deployed, immutable, automatically enforced
   - FOR THE KIDS uses this to make profit allocation immutable: 60% to charity, 30% infrastructure, 10% founder

2. **The corporate governance problem WIRED readers should care about:**
   - Boards can be pressured
   - Founders can change their minds
   - Investors can demand strategic pivots
   - Mission drift is almost inevitable

   Solution: Make the mission code, not culture. Make ethics executable, not just aspirational.

3. **The AI governance angle:**
   - Claude writes code following "Gospel" principles
   - The AI cannot generate code that violates the 60% allocation
   - This isn't AI doing whatever it wants—it's AI as constitutional enforcer
   - Perfect example of "Constitutional AI" moving from theory to production

4. **The "Internet of Trust" narrative:**
   - We're building systems where you don't need to trust individuals
   - You trust the math
   - You trust the code
   - You trust the immutable ledger

5. **Why this matters in 2025:**
   - Crypto hype faded, but blockchain utility is emerging
   - Generative AI governance is the next frontier
   - Corporate accountability is under intense scrutiny
   - Smart contracts for governance is unexplored territory

**The interview opportunity:**
Joshua Coleman is available for deep-dive on:
- Design decisions in planned smart contract (backend enforcement active) smart contract
- Why Base Mainnet was chosen over other blockchains
- How AI-generated code ensures mission compliance
- Philosophy of "code as governance"
- Why smart contracts work for accountability (not just finance)
- The future of immutable corporate systems

1. **"The Future of Corporate Governance Might Be On-Chain"**
   - Traditional governance vs. smart contract governance
   - What becomes possible when rules are immutable
   - Why this threatens traditional power structures

2. **"Can Code Enforce Ethics Better Than People?"**
   - FOR THE KIDS as case study
   - Constitutional AI in production
   - Limits and possibilities of algorithmic governance

3. **"Smart Contracts Are Going Mainstream—And It's Not What You Think"**
   - DeFi was hype, governance is real use case
   - How corporations will use blockchain for accountability
   - What it means for the future of business

4. **"The Founder Who Made Himself Powerless"**
   - Joshua Coleman's bet that architecture > incentives
   - Why humans can't be trusted with mission-critical decisions
   - How to build systems that outlast founders

5. **"What Happens When AI Writes the Rules"**

**Subject:** Re: [Original Subject] — Exclusive access to smart contract verification

**Body:**

Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],

Quick follow-up on my note from [DAY]. I know you're busy, but wanted to make sure this landed on your radar.

One thing I didn't mention: Joshua is willing to provide **exclusive access to the smart contract code, blockchain verification, and architecture documentation** for the right story. Everything is public on-chain, but having the founder walk through his design thinking is rare.

**New angle if you're interested:**
The smart contract (Planned (Q1 2026) on Base Mainnet) literally contains the entire 60/30/10 allocation logic. It's corporate governance in 200 lines of Solidity—immutable, transparent, and fascinating from a technical perspective.

If this interests you, I'd love to arrange a time to discuss potential angles.

Best,

## PART 7: JOURNALIST RELATIONSHIP BUILDING PLAN

### Strategy 1: Editorial Calendar Alignment

**Approach:** Map journalist coverage focus to story angles

**Identify:**
1. What each journalist typically covers (regular beat analysis)
2. What conferences/events they attend
3. What trending topics they write about
4. Their newsletter coverage (if applicable)

**Alignment:** Pitch ONLY stories that match their demonstrated interest

**Example:**
- TechCrunch covers AI governance? Pitch the "Constitutional AI in production" angle
- Forbes covers founder mindset? Pitch the "founder who took less" angle
- Wired covers emerging tech? Pitch the "smart contracts for governance" angle

---

### Strategy 2: Personal Relationship Building (Pre-Pitch)

**Approach:** Engage with their work before asking for coverage

**Tactics:**
1. **Read & respond to their recent articles** (thoughtful comments, not generic praise)
2. **Retweet/amplify their stories** on social media
3. **Reference their previous work in your pitch** ("I noticed you covered X—this is adjacent")
4. **Find something in common** (hometown, interest area, past projects)
5. **Wait for natural conversation starters** (if they cover related story, mention FOR THE KIDS)

**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks of engagement before pitching

---

### Strategy 3: The "Expert Source" Approach

**Approach:** Offer Joshua as an expert source for future stories (not just FOR THE KIDS coverage)

**Positioning:**
- Joshua as expert on: AI governance, blockchain for non-crypto use cases, mission-driven business models
- Offer availability for quote/comments on related stories
- Build relationship as trusted source, not just person asking for coverage

**Example email:**

> Hi [JOURNALIST NAME],
>
> I noticed your recent story on [RELATED TOPIC]. Joshua Coleman (founder of FOR THE KIDS) has deep expertise in this area and would be happy to provide commentary for your next piece on [related angle].
>
> If you ever need an expert quote on AI governance, blockchain accountability, or mission-driven business models, Joshua is available.
>
> No ask here—just wanted to make the connection for future stories you might be working on.

---

### Strategy 4: The "Exclusive" Carrot

**Approach:** Offer exclusivity to the right journalist

**Positioning:**
- First interview: Exclusive to your chosen publication for 48 hours
- Full access: Smart contract walkthrough, source code, metrics, founder availability
- No embargo: Can publish whenever ready, but you get first shot

**Tactical use:**
- For your TOP 3 target journalists, offer real exclusivity
- Creates urgency
- Increases likelihood they'll cover it

**Example:**

> Hi [TOP TIER JOURNALIST],
>
> I'm giving you first exclusive access to the FOR THE KIDS story. Joshua will do a full technical deep-dive, smart contract walkthrough, and extended interview—exclusively with [PUBLICATION] for 48 hours.
>
> After that window, we'll offer it to other outlets. But you get first shot and full access.
>
> Interested?

---

### Strategy 5: Podcast Booking as Relationship Bridge

**Approach:** Get Joshua on podcasts to build public profile, which makes journalists more likely to cover him

**Why it works:**
- Podcasts increase founder visibility and credibility
- Journalists see clips/episodes and become interested
- Creates "pull" instead of "push" PR
- Founder becomes easier to book (already media-trained)

**Targeting:**
- Start with smaller podcasts (Indie Hackers, founder-focused, AI-focused)
- Work way up to larger platforms
- Share clips on social media
- Send journalist these clips as part of pitch package

---

### Strategy 6: Conference Speaking Opportunities

**Approach:** Position Joshua as speaker at industry conferences

**Venues:**
- AI conferences (NeurIPS, AI Summit, AI World)
- Blockchain conferences (Consensus, Devcon)
- Business conferences (SXSW, Web Summit)
- Startup conferences (Y Combinator Demo Day adjacent)

**Why it matters:**
- Conference coverage creates media hook
- Journalists cover speakers they should profile
- Speaking visibility increases likelihood of feature coverage

---

### Strategy 7: The "Accidental Coverage" Play

**Approach:** Participate in communities where journalists lurk

**Venues:**
1. **Hacker News:**
   - Post "Show HN: Gospel-driven development, AI governance, smart contracts for charity"
   - Answer questions thoughtfully
   - Let community interest drive journalist interest

2. **Reddit:**
   - Participate in r/Entrepreneur, r/IAmA, r/Charity
   - Answer questions honestly
   - Link to platform when relevant

3. **Twitter/X:**
   - Tweet about lessons from building FOR THE KIDS
   - Engage with startup/AI/blockchain conversations
   - Journalists follow key conversations and pick up stories

4. **LinkedIn:**
   - Share founder perspective on mission-driven business
   - Publish article on alternative startup models
   - Network with other founders/investors

---

### Strategy 8: The Competitive Angle

**Approach:** Monitor competitors and use their coverage as leverage

**Tactic:**
- When similar companies get covered (even tangentially), mention to journalists:
> "You covered [Competitor] on [topic]. FOR THE KIDS is doing something similar but actually structured around immutable principles. Worth a look?"

**Why it works:**
- Journalists like "comparative" stories
- Existing coverage in space validates story idea
- Positions FOR THE KIDS as more interesting alternative

### Strategy 9: Journalist Gifting (Subtle)

**Approach:** Send thoughtful, relevant gifts to top journalists

**Ideas:**
- Custom "FOR THE KIDS" merchandise with mission message
- Book on smart contracts or AI governance with note about Joshua
- Lunch invitation with no expectation of coverage
- Advance access to major milestone announcement

**Important:** Only gifts that feel natural, not transactional

---

### Strategy 10: The "Behind-the-Scenes" Access

**Approach:** Invite interested journalists to witness/participate in key moments

**Opportunities:**
- Platform launch milestones
- Charity partnership announcements
- New infrastructure deployments
- Smart contract updates
- Code generation sessions (watch Claude in action)

**Why it works:**
- Journalist becomes invested in the story
- Personal connection drives coverage
- Exclusive access feeling

## PART 9: TRACKING & METRICS

### Media Outreach Tracker

**Create spreadsheet with columns:**
- [ ] Journalist name
- [ ] Publication
- [ ] Email/contact
- [ ] Date pitched
- [ ] Angle used
- [ ] First follow-up date
- [ ] Second follow-up date
- [ ] Response (Yes/No/Maybe)
- [ ] Article published (Y/N)
- [ ] Article link
- [ ] Impressions/reach

### Follow-up Checkpoints

**Day 4:** Did journalist read the pitch? (No data = assume not, send value-add follow-up)
**Day 10:** Has journalist mentioned covering this? (If no, send milestone follow-up)
**Day 15:** Is journalist receptive? (If yes, schedule interview)
**Day 20:** What's the status? (Soft close)
**Day 30:** Final decision point (move on if no interest)

## PART 10: CRISIS MANAGEMENT & DIFFICULT QUESTIONS

### Likely Challenging Questions from Skeptical Journalists

**Q1: "How do we know you're actually allocating 60%? What if you're lying?"**

**A:** Verify it yourself. The smart contract (Planned (Q1 2026)) is deployed on Base Mainnet. Every allocation is timestamped, immutable, and publicly verifiable on BaseScan. I can't hide the numbers even if I wanted to. The transparency is technical, not just words.

---

**Q2: "This seems too good to be true. What's the catch? What are you getting out of this?"**

**A:** The catch is that it's unscalable by venture capital standards. Traditional VCs will never invest because they need control of profits and equity dilution. I've made myself uninvestable—which is exactly the point. I'm betting that perpetual sustainability beats explosive growth.

Personally, I get 10% of profits (enough to live comfortably if the platform succeeds) and the knowledge that I built something that will outlast me. That's the trade-off.

---

**Q3: "Smart contracts are code. Code gets hacked. What if someone exploits the contract?"**

**A:** The contract is audited [IF TRUE: provide audit details]. More importantly, the contract is simple—it's just math. 60% of revenue goes to addresses, 30% to infrastructure, 10% to founder. Hard to hack simple math.

Also, the code is open-source [IF APPLICABLE]. Anyone can verify it. Security through transparency, not obscurity.

---

**Q4: "AI-written code sounds risky. What happens when Claude makes a mistake?"**

**A:** We have testing, validation, and federated AI governance. Claude isn't alone—Gemini validates logic, Grok manages infrastructure, Perplexity fact-checks. It's a board, not a single AI making all decisions.

Also, Claude generates code faster and more consistently than humans—with fewer shortcuts and less technical debt. It's not perfect, but it's better for mission-critical systems.

---

**Q5: "You're only 10% founder. How do you stay motivated if your upside is capped?"**

**A:** My upside is platform growth. If revenue grows, my 10% grows with it. But I'm also motivated by something else: Building something that works. Most founders optimize for exit. I optimize for perpetual operation. That's more interesting to me.

---

**Q6: "Isn't this just a tax write-off scheme?"**

**A:** We're a for-profit LLC, not a charity. The allocations to verified 501(c)(3) organizations are deductible business expenses. But if this were purely for tax optimization, I wouldn't lock myself into 60% forever—I'd keep it discretionary. The tax angle is a side benefit, not the driver.
