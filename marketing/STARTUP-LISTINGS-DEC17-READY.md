AI Does It All is a unified AI productivity platform designed for creators, developers, and small teams who want professional-grade AI capabilities without the premium price. Features include multi-model AI (Claude, Gemini, Grok), voice commands, real-time collaboration, and smart automation.

But here's what makes us different: We've hardcoded a revolutionary profit model. 60% of every subscription automatically flows to Verified Pediatric Charities via smart contract on Base Mainnet. This isn't charity theater�it's structural: your subscription directly funds pediatric care for children in need.

Other 40% split: 30% infrastructure/growth, 10% sustainable founder income.

Available now with free 7-day trial. FOR THE KIDS.
```

**First Comment (Maker's Comment - Critical!):**
```
Hey Product Hunt! ??

I'm Joshua Coleman, founder of AI Does It All, and I'm incredibly excited to share what we've built.

**The Problem:**
AI tools are fragmented. You use ChatGPT for one thing, Gemini for another, Claude for analysis. Context switching is exhausting. Plus, most AI companies are racing to maximize shareholder value�not social impact.

**Our Solution:**
AI Does It All integrates Claude, Gemini, and Grok into one beautiful interface with voice commands, real-time team collaboration, and smart automation.

But here's the revolutionary part: 60% of every subscription automatically flows to Verified Pediatric Charities via smart contract (Planned (Q1 2026) on Base Mainnet). This isn't discretionary giving�it's hardcoded. Immutable. Blockchain-verified.

**The Math:**
- Pro subscription: $29/month = $17.40/month to pediatric care
- Team subscription: $99/month = $59.40/month to pediatric care
- Your productivity subscription directly funds treatment for sick children

**What You Get:**
? Multi-model AI orchestration (automatic best-response routing)
? Voice commands with long-context memory
? Real-time collaboration (up to 100 users)
? Smart automation (no-code workflow builder)
? REST API for developers
? Mobile apps (iOS/Android)
? Enterprise security (2FA, SSO, audit logs)

**Free Tier:**
5 AI calls per day to test drive the multi-model experience.

**Why We Built This:**
Every year, over 10 million children in the US alone suffer from serious childhood diseases. Many families can't afford treatment. We believe tech companies can do better than "we'll contribute when it's convenient." So we hardcoded it.

**Try It Free:**

**Questions?**
I'll be here all day answering questions. Ask me anything about the tech, the mission, or the 60/30/10 revenue model.

FOR THE KIDS. ??

## MESSAGING QUICK REFERENCE

### When Asked: "Why 60% to charity?"
```
Because every child deserves access to quality healthcare. Our smart contract automatically allocates 60% of revenue to Verified Pediatric Charities. This isn't a promise�it's hardcoded. You can verify it on blockchain.
```

### When Asked: "Why should I trust you?"
```
We put our money where our mouth is. Smart contract Planned for Q1 2026 (backend allocation currently active) proves every transaction. Third-party audits verify the split quarterly. You don't have to trust us�you can verify us.
```

### When Asked: "Will you change the split later?"
```
No. It's immutable in the smart contract. No executive can change it. No investor can pressure us. It's permanent and blockchain-verified.
```

### When Asked: "What about the other 40%?"
```
30% funds our infrastructure: servers, AI APIs, support, development. 10% goes to the founder (Joshua Coleman) for sustainable income. We're not a non-profit�we're a profitable business with a conscience.
```
