## THREAD 1: "How I built a company that pays kids more than the CEO"

**Tweet 1/8:**
I just built a company where sick kids get 6X what I do.

VCs think I'm insane.

My lawyer said "you can't do that."

My AI said "watch me."

Here's how we hardcoded charity into smart contracts 🧵

**Tweet 2/8:**
The traditional model is broken:

💰 CEO takes 20-30%
💰 Investors take 40-50%
💰 Charity gets scraps (maybe 5%)

We flipped it:

🏥 Kids get 60%
⚙️ Infrastructure gets 30%
👨‍💻 Founder (me) gets 10%

This isn't CSR. It's the core business model.

**Tweet 3/8:**
"But how do you make money?"

By making LESS.

That 10% on $10M revenue = $1M/year.

I don't need a yacht. I need to sleep at night.

The kids need chemo, not my third vacation home.

**Tweet 4/8:**
The secret: SMART CONTRACTS.

We wrote the 60/30/10 split into Ethereum.

Can't be changed.
Can't be voted out.
Can't be "revised for shareholders."

Gospel V1.3 is IMMUTABLE.

Even I can't override it.

**Tweet 5/8:**
VCs HATE this:

"What about our returns?"
"What about scaling?"
"What about exit multiples?"

Wrong questions.

Right questions:
"How many kids can we help?"
"Can this run forever?"
"What if profit wasn't the only metric?"

**Tweet 6/8:**
The best part?

Kids don't care about my cap table.

They care that their hospital bills get paid.

60% of EVERY dollar goes straight to verified pediatric charities.

No committees.
No "efficiency reports."
Just medicine.

**Tweet 7/8:**
"Is this sustainable?"

YES.

We built AI tools that generate revenue.
Operating costs: 30%
Everything left over: Split the same way.

60% kids
30% ops
10% me

Forever.

**Tweet 8/8:**
We're on Kickstarter NOW: [LINK]

Early backers get lifetime access.

But more importantly: You're hardcoding hope into the blockchain.

Every pledge = More kids helped.

Who's in?

## THREAD 2: "The smart contract that can't be changed"

**Tweet 1/7:**
I wrote code that even I can't modify.

Locked 60% of all revenue to sick kids.

Forever.

VCs called it "financial suicide."

I call it "the only way to build trust."

Here's the tech breakdown 🧵

**Tweet 2/7:**
The problem with traditional charities:

📉 Board votes to reduce giving
📉 "Administrative costs" balloon to 40%
📉 Mission drift after founder exits
📉 No transparency

Solution: ETHEREUM SMART CONTRACTS

Immutable. Transparent. Permanent.

**Tweet 3/7:**
Gospel V1.3 Architecture:

```solidity
uint256 public constant KIDS = 60;
uint256 public constant OPS = 30;
uint256 public constant FOUNDER = 10;

// IMMUTABLE - Cannot be changed
```

That's it. That's the whole governance model.

No votes. No amendments. No loopholes.

**Tweet 4/7:**
Every revenue transaction triggers the split:

💵 Payment comes in
⚡ Smart contract executes
🏥 60% → Charity wallet (auto)
⚙️ 30% → Operations (auto)
👨‍💻 10% → Founder (auto)

All on-chain. All verifiable. All permanent.

**Tweet 5/7:**
"What if you need to change it?"

TOO BAD.

That's the point.

If I could change it, investors could pressure me.
If investors could change it, kids lose.

Immutability = Integrity.

**Tweet 6/7:**
The charity wallets are multi-sig:

3 of 5 signatures required:
- Verified charity rep
- Independent auditor
- Community DAO member
- AI oracle (yes, really)
- Founder

Even the disbursement is trustless.

**Tweet 7/7:**
This is the future of ethical business:

Code > Promises
Blockchain > Boardrooms
Immutability > "Good intentions"

You're not just supporting a product.
You're proving this model works.

## THREAD 3: "Why VCs hate our business model"

**Tweet 1/9:**
Had 8 VC meetings in 2 weeks.

All ended the same way:

"We love it, but..."
"The tech is great, but..."
"Can you change the 60% thing?"

NO.

Here's why VCs will NEVER fund ethical companies 🧵

**Tweet 2/9:**
VC Math:

They invest $1M
They want $100M back (100X)
That requires MAXIMIZING profit
Not MAXIMIZING impact

Our model?
60% → Kids
= 60% they'll never see

Their LP agreements literally forbid this.

**Tweet 3/9:**
Real quote from Sand Hill Road:

"Look, we admire the mission, but our fiduciary duty is to returns. Can you do 10% to charity and 50% to equity holders?"

Translation: "Make kids the side quest, not the main mission."

HARD PASS.

**Tweet 4/9:**
The VC playbook we rejected:

1️⃣ Raise at $10M valuation
2️⃣ "Prove the model" (cut charity to 5%)
3️⃣ Scale to $100M valuation
4️⃣ Exit / IPO
5️⃣ Charity becomes a PR line item

We chose a different game.

**Tweet 5/9:**
Our playbook:

1️⃣ Kickstarter (community owned)
2️⃣ 60% kids (hardcoded)
3️⃣ Grow sustainably
4️⃣ NEVER exit
5️⃣ Kids ALWAYS get 60%

No board to answer to.
No exit pressure.
No "pivot" away from the mission.

**Tweet 6/9:**
"But how do you scale without VC?"

SLOWLY.

Profitably.

Sustainably.

We don't need to be a unicorn.
We need to be a MARATHON RUNNER.

$1M/year helping kids > $100M exit helping no one.

**Tweet 7/9:**
The VC model optimizes for:
- Fast growth
- Winner-takes-all
- Exit events

We optimize for:
- Permanent impact
- Sustainable revenue
- NEVER exiting

These are incompatible.

**Tweet 8/9:**
So we're going to the PEOPLE.

Kickstarter backers don't want 100X returns.

They want:
✅ Great AI tools
✅ Transparent impact
✅ Kids getting help

That's our cap table: USERS.

**Tweet 9/9:**
Join the rebellion: [KICKSTARTER LINK]

Early backers get:
🎯 Lifetime access
🎯 Governance tokens
🎯 Proof this works

We're building the anti-VC company.

And we're doing it in PUBLIC.

## THREAD 4: "I put AI in charge of my charity"

**Tweet 1/10:**
My board of directors has 3 humans and 1 AI.

The AI has veto power over all charitable disbursements.

People think I'm crazy.

The AI just prevented $50K fraud.

Here's how AI governance actually works 🧵

**Tweet 2/10:**
The problem: HUMAN BIAS.

Even with good intentions:
- Favorite charities get preferential treatment
- Emotional decisions override data
- "I know a guy" trumps verification
- Optics > Impact

The AI doesn't have friends.

**Tweet 3/10:**
Meet "Guardian" - Our AI Auditor:

🤖 Monitors all transactions 24/7
🤖 Verifies charity 501(c)(3) status
🤖 Cross-checks disbursement amounts
🤖 Flags anomalies in real-time
🤖 Has read EVERY charity watchdog report

It never sleeps. Never takes bribes.

**Tweet 4/10:**
How it works:

1️⃣ Human proposes charity disbursement
2️⃣ Guardian checks:
   - IRS 501(c)(3) status ✓
   - CharityNavigator rating ✓
   - Recent audit reports ✓
   - Pediatric focus verification ✓
3️⃣ Approved = Multi-sig unlock
4️⃣ Rejected = Human review

**Tweet 5/10:**
Real example from last week:

Proposal: $50K to "Kids Health Foundation"

Guardian flagged:
⚠️ Founded 3 weeks ago
⚠️ No tax filings
⚠️ Admin costs: 95%
⚠️ CEO salary: $180K

REJECTED in 0.3 seconds.

Humans would've missed this.

**Tweet 6/10:**
"What if the AI makes a mistake?"

Human override exists.

But requires 4 of 5 multi-sig:
- 3 humans
- 1 AI
- 1 community DAO vote

The AI can be overruled.
But it takes CONSENSUS.

No single point of failure.

**Tweet 7/10:**
Guardian's track record (90 days):

✅ 47 charity verifications
❌ 8 fraud attempts blocked
⚡ $340K protected
📊 100% accuracy on 501(c)(3) checks
⏱️ Average verification: 12 seconds

Humans took 3-5 days per check.

**Tweet 8/10:**
The controversial part:

Guardian scores charities on IMPACT PER DOLLAR.

Not warm feelings.
Not brand recognition.
Not "I saw them on TV."

Cold, hard data:
- % that reaches kids
- Outcomes per $1000
- Administrative efficiency

**Tweet 9/10:**
"Doesn't this eliminate human judgment?"

NO.

It AUGMENTS it.

Humans decide WHICH charities align with mission.
AI verifies they're LEGITIMATE and EFFECTIVE.

Best of both worlds.

**Tweet 10/10:**
This is the future of DAOs:

AI + Humans in COLLABORATION.

Not AI replacing us.
Not humans winging it.

HYBRID GOVERNANCE.

## THREAD 5: "The $5,000 PC giveaway story"

**Tweet 1/8:**
We gave away a $5,000 gaming PC to a sick kid.

It got 2.3M impressions.

Raised $17K in 48 hours.

VCs said "that's not scalable."

I said "watch this."

Here's the ROI of radical generosity 🧵

**Tweet 2/8:**
Meet Jake (not real name).

12 years old.
Stage 3 leukemia.
Loves Minecraft.

His mom reached out: "He wants to play with friends during chemo. Can your AI help?"

We didn't send software.

We sent a BEAST of a PC.

**Tweet 3/8:**
The PC specs:

💻 RTX 4090
💻 i9-13900K
💻 64GB RAM
💻 2TB NVMe

Why overkill?

Because when you have 6 months of chemo, you deserve ZERO lag.

You deserve to forget you're sick.

Even if just for an hour.

**Tweet 4/8:**
What happened next:

📸 Jake's mom posted a photo
🔥 Local news picked it up
📺 Regional NBC affiliate ran segment
🌐 Reddit front page (r/UpliftingNews)
💰 Kickstarter traffic spiked 340%

Cost: $5K
Revenue impact: $17K in 48hrs

ROI: 340%

**Tweet 5/8:**
But here's the thing:

WE DIDN'T DO IT FOR ROI.

We did it because Gospel V1.3 says:

"60% to kids. Period."

That includes:
- Direct cash to hospitals
- Equipment for kids
- WHATEVER HELPS

The marketing was a side effect.

**Tweet 6/8:**
The "unscalable" criticism:

VC: "You can't give every kid a $5K PC."

ME: "You're right. But I can give THIS kid THIS PC. Today."

Scalability is a VC obsession.

IMPACT is ours.

**Tweet 7/8:**
The plan going forward:

🎮 1 PC giveaway per quarter
🏥 Targeted to kids in long-term treatment
📹 Documented (with family permission)
💝 Funded from the 60% charity allocation

It's literally what the money is FOR.

**Tweet 8/8:**
Jake finished chemo last month.

He's in remission.

He still plays Minecraft.

We still get updates from his mom.

THAT is what 60% to kids looks like.

Not a check to a charity.
A KID. A LIFE. A MOMENT.

## THREAD 6: "From hospital visits to blockchain code"

**Tweet 1/9:**
I started this in a hospital room.

My daughter (8 months old) was sick.

I watched families choose between rent and chemo.

I wrote the first smart contract on my phone.

This is that story 🧵

**Tweet 2/9:**
Children's Hospital, 2 AM:

My daughter was fine (thank God).

But the family next to us?

Dad on the phone: "I don't know how we're paying for next month. The insurance denied it again."

Mom crying quietly.

Kid (maybe 6) playing with a broken toy.

**Tweet 3/9:**
I'm a software engineer.

I'd been building AI tools for 5 years.

Made decent money.

And I'm sitting there thinking:

"I charge $200/hr for code. This kid might die because of paperwork."

The system is BROKEN.

**Tweet 4/9:**
That night, I opened my laptop (in the cafeteria, terrible coffee).

Started writing:

"What if every AI product I build automatically gives to kids like this?"

Not 5% charity.
Not a donation button.

HARDCODED into the business model.

**Tweet 5/9:**
First attempt: Traditional nonprofit.

❌ Took 6 months to get 501(c)(3)
❌ Board wanted control of funds
❌ "Administrative costs" kept growing
❌ Donations were unpredictable

I needed something PERMANENT.

Enter: Blockchain.

**Tweet 6/9:**
Gospel V1.3 was born:

```
60% → Kids (immutable)
30% → Operations (immutable)
10% → Founder (immutable)
```

Wrote it in Solidity.
Deployed to Ethereum mainnet.
Can NEVER be changed.

That 2 AM cafeteria code is now LAW.

**Tweet 7/9:**
Fast forward 18 months:

✅ $127K distributed to pediatric charities
✅ 14 families received direct assistance
✅ 3 hospitals partnered with us
✅ AI tools used by 2,300+ people
✅ 100% transparent on-chain

All from a hospital cafeteria idea.

**Tweet 8/9:**
The dad from that night?

We found him (through the hospital social worker).

His daughter got treatment.

Insurance eventually covered it.

But we covered the gap.

$8,400.

From the 60%.

**Tweet 9/9:**
This Kickstarter is that 2 AM vision.

Scaled.
Proven.
Ready to go global.

Early backers aren't customers.
You're CO-FOUNDERS of a movement.

Let's fix this broken system.

Together.

## THREAD 7: "Why 60% is the magic number"

**Tweet 1/7:**
We tested 50/30/20.

Then 55/30/15.

Then 60/30/10.

The data was clear:

60% is the MINIMUM to create systemic change.

Here's the math 🧵

**Tweet 2/7:**
Industry standard charity giving:

🏢 Corporate: 1-3%
🎗️ "Cause marketing": 5-10%
⭐ "Generous" companies: 15-20%

ALL of these are PR moves.

They don't change the CORE business model.

They're bolt-ons.

**Tweet 3/7:**
Gospel V1.3: 60%

Why 60?

Because at 60%, charity isn't a "program."

It's THE BUSINESS.

Product development SERVES the charity.
Marketing SERVES the charity.
Revenue SERVES the charity.

The tail doesn't wag the dog.

**Tweet 4/7:**
The 30% operations budget:

💻 Servers & infrastructure: ~10%
👨‍💻 Development (AI models): ~12%
📢 Marketing & growth: ~5%
⚖️ Legal & compliance: ~3%

We run LEAN.

Because every dollar not spent = more to kids.

**Tweet 5/7:**
The 10% founder share:

"Why not 0%?"

Because:
1️⃣ Sustainability (I need to eat)
2️⃣ Skin in the game (I'm incentivized to grow this)
3️⃣ Transparency (taking $0 invites suspicion)

10% is enough. Not greedy. Aligned.

**Tweet 6/7:**
What 60% enables:

At $1M revenue:
💰 $600K to kids

At $10M revenue:
💰 $6M to kids

At $100M revenue:
💰 $60M to kids

This isn't charity.
This is INFRASTRUCTURE for good.

**Tweet 7/7:**
We didn't pick 60% randomly.

We picked it because it's the MINIMUM to make charity the PRIMARY mission.

Anything less = Business first, kids second.

We flipped it.

## THREAD 8: "My AI board of directors"

**Tweet 1/10:**
My board meetings are weird.

3 humans, 1 AI, 1 DAO.

The AI votes.
The DAO votes.
Humans vote.

Last month, the AI outvoted me.

And saved us from a terrible decision.

Here's how AI governance actually works 🧵

**Tweet 2/10:**
Traditional boards:

👔 3-7 humans
👔 Meet quarterly
👔 Incentivized by stock options
👔 Groupthink
👔 "I know a guy" decisions

Our board:

🤖 2 humans, 1 AI, 1 DAO
🤖 Meets DAILY (async)
🤖 Incentivized by mission
🤖 Data > Feelings

**Tweet 3/10:**
The AI board member: "Oracle"

Trained on:
📊 Our financial data
📊 Charity effectiveness research
📊 Startup failure patterns
📊 Gospel V1.3 compliance

It has ONE job: Protect the 60%.

**Tweet 4/10:**
How Oracle votes:

Every proposal gets scored:

1️⃣ Does this help kids? (0-100)
2️⃣ Does this comply with Gospel V1.3? (Y/N)
3️⃣ What's the risk level? (Low/Med/High)
4️⃣ ROI estimate (data-driven)

If #2 = N, Oracle auto-votes NO.

**Tweet 5/10:**
Real example - Last month:

PROPOSAL: "Add premium tier at $299/mo, reduce charity split to 50% for that tier to increase margins."

ME: "This could boost revenue 40%!"

ORACLE: "⚠️ GOSPEL V1.3 VIOLATION - VOTE: NO"

I was outvoted 3-1.

Oracle was RIGHT.

**Tweet 6/10:**
Why Oracle was right:

If we create a "premium non-charity tier":

❌ Mission drift starts
❌ We optimize for premium (higher margin)
❌ 60% tier becomes "budget option"
❌ 5 years later, we're a normal SaaS

Oracle saw the slippery slope.

**Tweet 7/10:**
The DAO board member:

Community token holders vote (weighted).

Last vote: "Should we add ads to free tier?"

🗳️ 847 votes
📊 73% NO
✅ Ads rejected

The community keeps us honest.

**Tweet 8/10:**
Board composition:

1️⃣ Founder (me) - Product vision
2️⃣ Operations lead - Execution
3️⃣ Oracle (AI) - Gospel compliance
4️⃣ DAO community - User advocacy
5️⃣ Independent auditor - Financial oversight

No single point of failure.

**Tweet 9/10:**
The controversial take:

AIs make BETTER board members for ethical companies.

Why?

✅ No financial incentive to cheat
✅ No ego
✅ No "I'm tired, let's approve this"
✅ 24/7 monitoring
✅ Perfect memory of bylaws

Humans + AI > Humans alone.

**Tweet 10/10:**
This is the future of DAOs:

Not AI replacing humans.
Not humans ignoring AI.

HYBRID GOVERNANCE.

Each brings strengths.
Each has veto power.
Each protects the mission.

## THREAD 9: "The founder who fired himself"

**Tweet 1/8:**
I wrote myself OUT of the company bylaws.

Can't change the 60% split.
Can't fire the AI auditor.
Can't override the DAO.

My lawyer said: "You're making yourself irrelevant."

I said: "EXACTLY."

Here's why 🧵

**Tweet 2/8:**
The startup founder trap:

You start with a mission.
You raise money.
Investors want board seats.
You get outvoted.
Mission becomes "let's talk about mission after we hit our numbers."

10 years later: You're just another SaaS.

**Tweet 3/8:**
I watched this happen to 3 friends:

Friend A: Started ed-tech for underserved kids.
Now: Sells to wealthy private schools.

Friend B: Started affordable healthcare app.
Now: Premium-only, $50/mo.

Friend C: Started "ethical AI."
Now: Sells to defense contractors.

**Tweet 4/8:**
The problem: FOUNDER CONTROL.

As long as I CAN change the mission, investors will pressure me to.

As long as I CAN reduce charity %, I'm a liability.

Solution: REMOVE MY ABILITY TO BETRAY THE MISSION.

**Tweet 5/8:**
What I hardcoded:

🔒 60/30/10 split (immutable smart contract)
🔒 AI auditor (can't be fired without DAO vote)
🔒 Charity criteria (Gospel V1.3 in bytecode)
🔒 Decision matrix (I'm 1 of 5 votes)

I'm a STEWARD, not a KING.

**Tweet 6/8:**
Real scenario - 2 months ago:

An investor offered $2M.

Terms: "Reduce charity to 20%, standard equity split."

Old me: "I should consider this."

NEW SYSTEM: "Gospel V1.3 violation - Oracle votes NO, DAO votes NO, I'm outvoted even if I wanted to say yes."

CAN'T SELL OUT.

**Tweet 7/8:**
"Why would you limit yourself like this?"

Because the mission is BIGGER than me.

I'll be gone someday.
The code will remain.

I'm building something that outlives me.

That requires making myself REPLACEABLE.

**Tweet 8/8:**
This is the anti-founder-cult company:

No "visionary CEO" worship.
No "only I can run this."
No "the mission is whatever I say it is."

The mission is CODE.
And code doesn't have an ego.
