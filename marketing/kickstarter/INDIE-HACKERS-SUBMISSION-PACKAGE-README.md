## WHAT MAKES THIS POST WORK

### 1. Indie Hackers Community Values

**The IH audience respects:**
- Specificity (contract addresses, real numbers)
- Transparency (showing actual constraints)
- Vulnerability (admitting what's hard)
- Execution (shipping real things, not ideas)
- Bootstrapping (no VC, real survival pressure)

**This post delivers all five.**

### 2. The Business Model Angle

**Not a charity pitch. It's a business model innovation story:**

"I made profit allocation structural (smart contract) instead of aspirational (mission statement), and here's what happened to my unit economics, customer trust, and team quality."

**Why this works:**
- Builders care about business models
- Technical proof (smart contract) beats promises
- Constraint stories resonate (10% founder allocation)
- Network effects (other founders want to copy it)

### 3. The Built-with-AI Angle

**"One founder + AI agents (Claude, Gemini, Grok)"**

This is catnip for Indie Hackers because:
- Cost efficiency (zero payroll)
- Speed advantage (24/7 development)
- Novel approach (most haven't tried this)
- Replicable (they could do this too)

### 4. The Gospel V1.3 Hook

**60/30/10 split mentioned 8+ times:**

This repetition is intentional. By the end of the post, readers remember:
- 60% to charity (not 60%, not "some")
- Backend system enforces it (not promises)
- First $60K goes 100% to Shriners
- After funded: split permanent

**Memorability = Shareability**

---

## KEY MESSAGES (EMBED IN ALL RESPONSES)

### Primary message:
"We made profit allocation structural (code) instead of aspirational (promises)."

### Supporting messages:
1. Built by one founder + AI agents ($25K, no VC)
2. Smart contract on Base Mainnet (auditable forever)
3. First $60K ? 100% to Shriners Children's Hospitals
4. After funded: 60/30/10 split permanent
5. Constraint forced better decisions (unit economics, team, trust)

### Technical proof points:
- Contract address: `Planned (Q1 2026)`
- Kickstarter: https://aidoesitall.website
- Gospel V1.3 compliance: 60/30/10 split
- Base Mainnet (low gas, fast confirmations)

---

## RESPONSE TEMPLATES (COPY-PASTE READY)

### For: "How do I know you won't change the split?"

```
Fair question. I'd be skeptical too.

The difference: it's not a promise, it's code.

Smart contract on Base: Planned (Q1 2026)

What you can verify:
- Every allocation ever made (Basescan transaction history)
- beneficiary allocation addresses (hardcoded, immutable)
- Revenue splits (code matches 60/30/10)
- DAO voting history (charity selection)

You could audit all of this. Not as faith�as technical review.

What would make you trust this more?
```

### For: "Why not just contribute directly to charity?"

```
Great question. Two reasons:

1. Scalability: As we grow, the 60% scales with us. A one-time
   contribution is finite. Structural allocation grows infinitely.

2. Accountability: Smart contract forces us to allocate monthly.
   We can't "forget" or "cut it this quarter." It's automatic.

This isn't about charity vs. for-profit. It's about making
allocation infrastructure instead of aspiration.

Does that make sense?
```

### For: "What's your runway?"

```
Honest answer:

Personal savings: $25K invested (down to ~$11K now)
Revenue: $[X]/month (from 2 paying customers)
Burn rate: ~$2K/month (infrastructure + legal)
Runway: ~5 months at current burn

Kickstarter goal: $60K (100% to Shriners, but proves model)
After funded: 60/30/10 split gives me 10% ($[X]/month)

I'm not hiding the precarity. This is bootstrap mode.
But the constraint forces efficiency.
```

### For: "How do you hire with only 30% for infrastructure?"

```
We don't have traditional employees yet. Here's the model:

1. AI agents (Claude, Gemini, Grok) handle code/deployment
2. Contractors for specialized work (legal, design)
3. DAO governance for community work (token rewards)

Result: Zero payroll, but production-quality output.

When we do hire, it'll be people who want THIS model.
Lower salary, higher mission alignment, equity-free.

Already had 3 inquiries from people who specifically want
to work on structural ethics. Team quality > team size.
```

### For: "What if the smart contract has a bug?"

```
Excellent concern.

Current state:
- Contract audited by [firm/community]
- Bounty program for vulnerability reports
- Multi-sig on charity wallets (security layer)
- Test allocations completed successfully

But you're right: bugs happen. If someone finds one:
1. I want to know immediately
2. Bounty payment for legitimate vulnerabilities
3. Full transparency post-mortem
4. Community vote on fix

Building in public means admitting code isn't perfect.
I'd rather fix it now than discover it later.

Want to audit? Happy to walk through the contract.
```

**Template:**
```
This is helpful pushback. [Restate their concern as real problem]

Here's how we're thinking about it: [Explain mechanism]

Where do you see the gap? [Invite specific feedback]
```

### Problem: Technical vulnerability found

**Solutions:**
- Thank them immediately (publicly)
