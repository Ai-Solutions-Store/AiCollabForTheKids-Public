## Tech Founder Waives Entire Personal Cut: 100% of First $60K Kickstarter Goal Goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals

**AI-Powered Platform with Blockchain Transparency Launches 30-Day Crowdfunding Campaign to Help Pediatric Patients**

**GAINESVILLE, FL - December 16, 2025** - TRASH OR TREASURE ONLINE RECYCLER LLC today announced the launch of a groundbreaking Kickstarter campaign for FOR THE KIDS, an artificial intelligence platform where the majority of all revenue flows directly to verified pediatric charities through verified backend allocation (smart contract planned Q1 2026).

In an unprecedented move, founder Joshua Coleman has waived his entire personal allocation (10%) and the infrastructure allocation (30%) for the duration of the Kickstarter campaign, directing 100% of the first $60,000 raised straight to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

"Most companies promise to allocate someday when they're profitable," said Coleman. "We're doing the opposite. We're helping kids first, before we take a single dollar for ourselves. This isn't marketing - it's a mathematical commitment verified on the blockchain."

### The Platform: Where Technology Meets Mission

FOR THE KIDS (aidoesitall.website) operates under what Coleman calls "Gospel V1.3" - an immutable 60/30/10 revenue split enforced by smart contracts:

- **60% to Verified Pediatric Charities** (currently partnering with Shriners Children's Hospitals)
- **30% to Infrastructure** (servers, AI costs, platform maintenance)
- **10% to Founder** (sustainable development)

The split is hardcoded into blockchain smart contracts deployed on Base Mainnet, making it mathematically impossible for anyone - including the founder - to alter the allocation without platform shutdown safeguards triggering.

### Blockchain Transparency Sets New Standard

Unlike traditional charity platforms that rely on trust and annual reports, FOR THE KIDS leverages blockchain technology to provide real-time transparency. Every transaction is recorded on-chain and publicly auditable through BaseScan.

"We don't ask people to trust us," Coleman explained. "The code is open-source. The smart contracts are public. Anyone can verify that 60% is actually going to children's hospitals. That level of transparency simply didn't exist before blockchain."

### AI-Powered Operations, Human-Centered Mission

The platform is managed by an unprecedented collaboration of four leading AI systems:

- **Claude (Anthropic)** - Code architecture and security auditing
- **Gemini/Jules (Google)** - Business logic and compliance monitoring
- **Perplexity** - Fact-checking and verification
- **Grok (xAI)** - Strategic planning and infrastructure

"This isn't about replacing humans - it's about creating systems that can't be corrupted," Coleman said. "The AIs don't sleep, don't embezzle, and don't forget the mission. They enforce the 60% allocation 24/7, forever."

### From Struggle to Service

Coleman's commitment to children's causes stems from personal experience. As someone who faced hardship in his youth and benefited from community support, he built FOR THE KIDS on a simple principle: those who succeed have an obligation to help those who are struggling.

"People helped me when I had nothing. Now I'm in a position to help kids at scale. This platform will outlive me - the smart contracts will keep allocating funds to pediatric charities long after I'm gone. That's the legacy I want to build."

### Kickstarter Campaign Details

- **Goal:** $100,000 in 30 days
- **Remaining:** 18 days
- **Founder Commitment:** 100% of first $60K to Shriners Children's Hospitals
- **Verification:** All contributions tracked on-chain via smart contract
- **Platform Launch:** Rolling deployment at aidoesitall.website

Funds raised will support platform development, AI model integration, security infrastructure, and initial operational costs - while immediately directing campaign proceeds to verified pediatric medical care.

### Industry Disruption Through Radical Transparency

FOR THE KIDS represents a fundamental shift in how technology companies can integrate charitable giving into their core business model. Rather than treating philanthropy as a side project or tax strategy, the platform makes charity mathematically inseparable from profitability.

"We're proving you can build a sustainable business that gives the majority of its profits away," Coleman said. "Not 2%, not 10% - sixty percent. And we're using blockchain to prove it's actually happening."
