## FULL SCRIPT

### [00:00-00:12] EMOTIONAL HOOK
**VISUAL:** Slow zoom on empty hospital bed, soft morning light through window. Child's drawing on bedside table.

**AUDIO:** Gentle piano, single sustained note

**NARRATOR (Joshua Coleman, conversational):**
"Right now, there's a kid in a hospital bed who shouldn't have to worry about whether they can afford treatment."

**TEXT ON SCREEN:** None (let the visual breathe)

---

### [00:13-00:28] THE BROKEN PROMISE
**VISUAL:** Fast cut montage - Corporate logos fading, "proceeds" fine print zooming in, vague charity language

**AUDIO:** Piano shifts to minor key, subtle tension

**NARRATOR:**
"We've all heard companies say they 'give back.' Some proceeds. A portion. Maybe.

But what if you could PROVE where every dollar goes?"

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**
- "Some proceeds = ???"
- "Where does it actually go?"

---

### [00:29-00:45] THE SOLUTION
**VISUAL:** Clean dashboard animation showing real-time split: 60% → 30% → 10%. Blockchain transaction visualized as glowing path.

**AUDIO:** Music builds, hopeful progression

**NARRATOR:**
"I'm Joshua Coleman. I built aidoesitall.website with one immutable rule:

60% of ALL revenue goes directly to verified pediatric charities.

Not some. Not eventually. **Sixty percent. Always.**

Locked in code. Verified on the blockchain. Impossible to change."

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**
- "60% → Verified Pediatric Charities"
- "30% → Infrastructure"
- "10% → Founder"
- "LOCKED IN SMART CONTRACT"

---

### [00:46-01:00] THE TIERS (RAPID FIRE)
**VISUAL:** Quick carousel of reward tiers with icons/graphics

**AUDIO:** Upbeat, energetic

**NARRATOR:**
"Back us at any level - from $10 to $1,000.

Every tier unlocks AI-powered tools, platform access, and founding member benefits.

But here's what matters: 60% goes to kids who need it most."

**TEXT ON SCREEN (rapid succession):**
- "$10 → SUPPORTER"
- "$25 → BELIEVER"
- "$100 → CHAMPION"
- "$1,000 → FOUNDER"
- "ALL LEVELS → 60% TO KIDS"

---

### [01:01-01:15] THE URGENT CTA
**VISUAL:** Return to hospital - same room, but now filled with family, laughter, recovery. Child holding the drawing from earlier.

**AUDIO:** Music swells to emotional peak

**NARRATOR:**
"We're raising $100,000. 60% of that is $60,000 for verified pediatric charities.

This campaign ends soon. Every pledge is locked to the mission.

**Visit aidoesitall.website. Back the future. For the kids.**"

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**
- "aidoesitall.website"
- "$100,000 GOAL"
- "$60,000 DIRECTLY TO KIDS"
- "BACK NOW"

**FINAL FRAME:**
**VISUAL:** Logo lockup with URL

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**
"FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS."
"aidoesitall.website"

**AUDIO:** Soft resolution, gentle fade

- **Color palette:** Coral (#CC785C), Blue (#078EFA), Teal (#20808D), Gold (#F4B400)

### Audio Production
- **Narrator:** Joshua Coleman (founder voice = authenticity) OR warm, trustworthy voiceover artist
- **Music:** Original score, starts minimal and builds emotional arc
