### Post 1: Professional Appeal
```
I spent 6 months convincing AI agents I was serious about giving to children's hospitals.

Then I put it on-chain. Then I waived my cut entirely.

TX: 0x6f78...dc07d (Base Mainnet)

100% of the first $60,000 pledged goes DIRECTLY to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

Not 60%. ONE HUNDRED PERCENT.

I took nothing. Infrastructure takes nothing. Just kids.

After the $60K goal:
• 60% → verified pediatric charities
• 30% → immortal infrastructure
• 10% → founder sustainability

We're live on Kickstarter. 72 hours left.

Title: I'm giving 100% of my Kickstarter's first $60K to Shriners Children's (transparent allocation tracking)

I'm Josh, founder of You & I Not AI.

For 6 months, I've been building an AI-powered dating platform. Today I'm putting my money where my mouth is:

100% of the first $60,000 pledged goes DIRECTLY to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

I waived my founder cut. Infrastructure waived too. EVERY DOLLAR to kids.

TX: 0x6f78...dc07d (Base Mainnet)

After $60K, the permanent split kicks in:
- 60% → Children's hospitals
- 30% → Infrastructure
- 10% → Founder

We're on Kickstarter now with 72 hours left. AMA about the tech, the ethics, or why I decided to take nothing from the first $60K.
