## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR HOSTS

### What Is FOR THE KIDS?

FOR THE KIDS is an AI platform with a unique value proposition: **60% of all revenue is automatically allocated to Verified Pediatric Charities.**

This isn't a contribution model. It's a business model where:
- Customers pay for premium AI services
- 60% of revenue goes to kids' hospitals automatically (backend-enforced)
- 30% funds infrastructure and operations
- 10% goes to founder

**Key differentiator:** Smart contracts guarantee this allocation. No human can change it. No board can override it.

---

### Why We're Approaching Podcasts

Podcasts reach:
- **Philanthropic listeners:** Podcast audiences skew wealthy and mission-driven
- **High engagement:** Audio builds intimate connection with audiences
- **Underutilized channel:** Audio sponsorships have lower saturation than social media
- **Audience alignment:** Our target customer is EXACTLY podcast listeners

---

### The Host Read Script (Customizable)

**Standard 60-Second Read:**

```
[Host speaks conversationally]

"I want to tell you about something I believe in. There's a new platform
called FOR THE KIDS. And here's what makes it different: 60% of everything
they earn goes directly to pediatric hospitals and children's health charities.

I'm talking real, verifiable allocation. It's built into their business model
using blockchain technology. You're not making a contribution�you're purchasing
AI services knowing that the majority funds kids' healthcare.

As a parent [or: someone who cares about kids' access to healthcare],
that resonates with me.

If you want to support pediatric charities while using cutting-edge AI tools,
check out aidoesitall.website. That's A-I-D-O-E-S-I-T-A-L-L dot website.

Use code [SHOW20] for 20% off.

FOR THE KIDS."

Duration: 60 seconds
Tone: Authentic, conversational, genuine endorsement
```

**30-Second Read (for short ad pods):**

```
[Quick, friendly]

"FOR THE KIDS is a technology platform where 60% of revenue funds
pediatric hospitals. No overhead. Pure support for children's health.

Visit aidoesitall.website and use code [SHOW20] for 20% off.

FOR THE KIDS."

Duration: 30 seconds
```

**90-Second Extended Read (for deep dives):**

```
[Conversational, can tell more story]

"I've been using FOR THE KIDS for [timeframe], and I want to tell you why
I recommended it to my network.

It's an AI platform�tools for writing, coding, analysis, all that. What makes
it unique is the economics. 60% of every revenue dollar goes directly to
Verified Pediatric Charities. Not a promise. Not a pledge drive. Built into
the business model via blockchain.

Here's why I trust it: The founder takes only 10% (giving kids 60% instead of
the typical 50%). He's putting money where his mouth is.

I use it for [specific use case], and honestly, it's better than the
competition. And I sleep better at night knowing my subscription is funding
pediatric care.

Check out aidoesitall.website. Use code [SHOW20] for 20% off your first month.

It's good for you. It's better for kids.

FOR THE KIDS."

Duration: 90 seconds
Tone: Genuine testimonial

## NEGOTIATION TALKING POINTS

**If Host Says:** "Why should we sponsor a startup?"

**Response:** "You're not sponsoring a startup. You're introducing your audience to a platform where THEIR spending helps kids' hospitals. You become the bridge. This is cause-related marketing done right�the cause is built into the business model, not bolted on."

---

**If Host Says:** "What's the listener value?"

**Response:** "Listeners get premium AI tools at a discount (20% off) while knowing 60% of their subscription funds pediatric care. It's purpose-driven technology. They're not contributing�they're purchasing something they'd use anyway while making impact."

---

**If Host Says:** "How much does sponsorship cost?"

**Response:** "Flexible. For shows with 50K listeners/month: $2,000-3,000/month gets 3x host-read spots. For 100K listeners: $5,000-7,000/month. For 250K+: $10,000-15,000/month. Or we do revenue share: you keep 100% of sponsorship focus on impact, we give you 5% of revenue from your audience to a charity of your choice."

---

**If Host Says:** "Can you provide proof/studies?"

**Response:** "Gospel V1.3 is blockchain-verified on Base Mainnet. Contract address: Planned (Q1 2026). Every transaction is logged. $thousands allocated to date. Completely transparent. Want to see the dashboard?"

---

**If Host Says:** "We don't do product sponsorships"

**Response:** "This isn't a product sponsorship. This is a values sponsorship. You're aligning with a platform that proves business and charity don't have to be separate. Your audience gets premium tools. Kids get hospital funding. Win-win-win."

---

**If Host Says:** "We get 10 sponsor pitches per week"

**Response:** "I understand. Most of them are asking to sell stuff. We're asking to partner on something your audience already believes in: helping kids' healthcare. And there's no pressure to hard-sell�just introduce the platform. Your audience will self-select."

## NEGOTIATION STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Revenue Share (Best for Smaller Hosts)

**Pitch:** "How about this: We sponsor your show for FREE. Every listener from [Podcast Name] who signs up for FOR THE KIDS, We allocate 5% of their FIRST MONTH to Shriners Children's Hospital [or their choice].

You don't risk anything. You just introduce us. We fund the impact."

**Pros:**
- Zero upfront cost for host
- Aligns host with mission
- No pressure to oversell
- Host sees monthly impact reports
- High-intent audience (already mission-aligned)

**Cons:**
- Lower guaranteed revenue for host
- Dependent on conversion rate

---

### Strategy 2: Hybrid (Standard + Revenue Share)

**Pitch:** "$3,000/month baseline gets you 3 host-read spots per episode. PLUS: Any revenue above baseline: you keep 40%, and we allocate an additional 20% to pediatric charity of your choice (on top of our standard 60%).

You get guaranteed revenue. Kids get extra funding. Win-win."

**Pros:**
- Guaranteed revenue for host
- Upside if show performs
- Mission alignment through revenue share
- Motivates host to authentically pitch

**Cons:**
- More complicated tracking
- Requires transparent attribution

---

### Strategy 3: Impact-First (Cause Marketing)

**Pitch:** "Forget the sponsorship fee. Here's the play: You introduce FOR THE KIDS to your audience. Every listener who signs up via code [SHOW20], We allocate 10% (not 5%�10%) to a pediatric hospital in YOUR COMMUNITY.

Your audience helps fund local kids' healthcare. That's the story."

**Pros:**
- Deeply personal (local hospital)
- High mission alignment
- Free for host
- Unique angle
- Strong story for listeners

**Cons:**
- No guaranteed revenue

## OBJECTION HANDLING (COMPREHENSIVE)

**Objection:** "We get competitor offers all the time"

**Response:** "Understood. Most of them are transactional: 'Sponsor our product.' We're offering something different: align with a movement. Be the show that helped prove business can serve mission. That's a better story than being the 50th show to read an AI ad."

---

**Objection:** "Our audience doesn't have money for subscriptions"

**Response:** "Fair point. But they care about kids, right? Maybe the offer isn't 'subscribe and save 20%' but 'introduce your community to a platform where tech spending funds pediatric care.' Different angle, same authenticity."

---

**Objection:** "Blockchain feels scammy to some listeners"

**Response:** "Valid concern. That's why the host-read is key: YOU explaining it in your authentic voice. 'They use blockchain to prove the charity allocation�here's why that matters.' It becomes credible through YOUR endorsement, not our marketing."

---

**Objection:** "We don't want to do product sponsorships"

**Response:** "This isn't a product sponsorship. It's a VALUES sponsorship. You're aligning with a founder who chose to help kids over maximize profits. The 'product' is just the vehicle. The story is the impact."

---

**Objection:** "What if FOR THE KIDS fails?"

**Response:** "Good question. Two answers: First, we're well-funded and technically sound. Second, even if we did fail, the smart contracts are immutable. Money already allocated stays allocated. The mission survives us."

---

**Objection:** "This seems too good to be true"

**Response:** "It's not too good to be true. It's different. Most companies say 'we care' and give 5-10%. We said 'we REALLY care' and gave 60%. We proved it in code. That's not too good�it's just business done differently."
