## SECTION 3: GOSPEL V1.3 COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION

### Revenue Split Integrity Check

**Principle:** Affiliate commissions are paid from Infrastructure (30%) and Founder (10%) portions. The 60% to children NEVER changes.

**Scenario 1: Customer Subscribes to $99/mo Plan (No Affiliate)**
```
Charity:         $59.40 (60%)
Infrastructure:  $29.70 (30%)
Founder:         $9.90  (10%)
TOTAL:           $99.00
```

**Scenario 2: Customer Subscribes to $99/mo Plan (Via Silver Affiliate - 20% Commission)**
```
Charity:         $59.40 (60%) ? UNCHANGED
Infrastructure:  $9.90  (10%) ? Reduced from $29.70
Founder:         $9.90  (10%) ? Unchanged
Affiliate:       $19.80 (20%) ? Comes from Infrastructure portion

TOTAL:           $99.00
Children's share: Still 60% ($59.40)
```

**Scenario 3: Customer Subscribes to $99/mo Plan (Via Platinum Affiliate - 30% Commission)**
```
Charity:         $59.40 (60%) ? UNCHANGED
Infrastructure:  $5.94  (6%)  ? Reduced
Founder:         $3.96  (4%)  ? Reduced
Affiliate:       $29.70 (30%) ? Comes from both Infrastructure and Founder

TOTAL:           $99.00
Children's share: Still 60% ($59.40)
```

**Gospel Compliance Guarantee:**
- ? Affiliate commissions NEVER reduce the 60% to children
- ? 60% is hardcoded and untouchable
- ? Scaling commissions up to 30% still maintains Gospel V1.3
- ? If split ever changes, platform automatically shuts down

---

### Language Compliance (CRITICAL)

**REQUIRED Language:**
- ? "60% of revenue goes to verified pediatric charities"
- ? "Gospel V1.3: 60/30/10 split"
- ? "Revenue allocation: 60% Charity / 30% Infrastructure / 10% Founder"
- ? "Profit allocation model"
- ? "Backend system enforces the split"

**FORBIDDEN Language (Auto-Fix Any Violations):**

- ? "10% founder" ? Change to "10% founder"
- ? "Gospel V1.3" ? Change to "Gospel V1.3"

> - 60% to Verified Pediatric Charities (IMMUTABLE)
> - 30% to Infrastructure & Operations
> - 10% to Founder
>
> Affiliate commissions are paid from the 30% Infrastructure and 10% Founder portions only.

> and cannot be changed by any party. If the split ever changes, all affiliate agreements are void.
>

## SECTION 4: AFFILIATE TRACKING & ATTRIBUTION

### Technical Implementation

**Primary System:** Custom tracking via `api/routes/affiliate-tracking.js`

**Backup Systems:**
- UTM parameters (Google Analytics integration)
- Cookie-based attribution (90-day window for standard affiliates, 90+ for premium)
- Manual review system for disputes
- Database schema for persistent referral records

### Tracking Workflow

**Step 1: Link Generation**
- System generates unique code: `FTKIDS-[AFFILIATENAME]`
- URL created: `aidoesitall.website/?aff=FTKIDS-[AFFILIATENAME]`
- QR code generated (for offline/print promotion)
- Short link created: `ftk.link/[AFFILIATENAME]`

**Step 2: Click Tracking**
- Logs: timestamp, IP, user agent, referrer
- Cookie set: `ftkids_affiliate=[CODE]` with expiration based on tier
- UTM parameters appended: `utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=[CODE]`
- Redirect to landing page (cookie intact)

**Step 3: Conversion Tracking**
- System checks for `ftkids_affiliate` cookie on signup
- Matches to affiliate record in database
- Logs conversion: Referral table entry with affiliate_id, user_id, subscription_id
- Sends email to affiliate: "You earned a referral!"

**Step 4: Commission Calculation (Monthly, 1st of Month)**
- Query all active subscriptions with affiliate attribution
- Calculate: `subscription_price � commission_rate � number_of_active_months`
- Update affiliate: `pending_balance += commission_amount`
- Generate invoice (PDF download)

**Step 5: Payout (15th of Each Month)**
- Query affiliates with `pending_balance >= $50`
- Initiate payout via Stripe Connect / PayPal
- Send email confirmation
- Reset pending_balance to $0

---

### Attribution Rules (Detailed)

**90-Day Cookie Window (Standard Affiliates):**

- User subscribes (Day 15) ? **Affiliate A gets commission** ?

**Last-Click Override (Same Session):**
- User clicks Affiliate A link ? Lands on homepage
- User immediately clicks Affiliate B link (same session) ? Cookie updates to Affiliate B
- User subscribes ? **Affiliate B gets commission** ?

**Manual Review Process:**
- Affiliate submits dispute ticket (with evidence)
- Founder reviews tracking logs
- If system error: Manual credit issued
- If user deliberately bypassed link: No credit issued

---

### Fraud Prevention Mechanisms

**Self-Referral Detection:**
- Email matching: Does subscriber email = affiliate email?

**Incentivized Click Detection:**
- Monitor conversion rates (normal: 3-10%, fraud: 60%+)
- Flag high-performing affiliates for investigation
- Investigate: Are they "paying users to sign up"?

**Cookie Stuffing Detection:**
- Monitor: Multiple affiliate cookies from same IP in short timeframe
- Flag: Affiliate account for review
- Terminate: If confirmed

**Fake Account Detection:**
- Payment method validation (real card, not prepaid)
- Behavioral analysis (dormant accounts tied to same affiliate)
- Action: Flag for review ? Terminate if confirmed

**Chargebacks & Refund Abuse:**
- 30-day pending period (commission not paid until refund window closes)

Joshua Coleman built an AI tools company called FOR THE KIDS with this model: 60% to verified pediatric charities, 30% to infrastructure, 10% to himself (Gospel V1.3).

This allocation is different from most companies because the founder voluntarily structured the company to maximize child impact from day one.

After 14 hours of deliberation on the Ethics Override, he chose to commit the majority of revenue directly to verified pediatric charities—permanently encoded in the platform's smart contracts.

**60% to charity. 30% infrastructure. 10% founder. Immutable.**

Why I'm sharing: If a founder is willing to reduce his own allocation to help more kids, that tells you something about the company.

### SOCIAL MEDIA COPY (7 Ready-to-Post)

#### POST 1: SIMPLE ANNOUNCEMENT
"I just discovered an AI tools company that allocates 60% of revenue to children's hospitals.

60%. Not 5%. Not 'some profits.' 60% of EVERY dollar.

It's called FOR THE KIDS, and they've already helped 396,000+ kids.

If you need AI tools for your business anyway, might as well use ones that fund pediatric care. ??

"POV: You're using AI tools that help kids ??

I've been testing @forthekidsai for [DURATION], and it's lowkey genius:

? Functional AI software
? 60% of revenue ? verified pediatric charities
? Blockchain-verified (smart contract, fully transparent)
? Already helped 396K+ children

The founder literally reduced his allocation from 20% to 10% to give more to kids. Wild.

"Interesting business model:

FOR THE KIDS sells AI-powered business tools with this revenue split:
� 60% ? Verified pediatric charities

Hardcoded in smart contract (Base mainnet). Can't be changed.

#### POST 4: FOUNDER STORY (LINKEDIN)
"Founder spotlight: Joshua Coleman

He built an AI tools company with 60/30/10 split: 60% to verified pediatric charities, 30% infrastructure, 10% founder (Gospel V1.3).

This allocation is permanently encoded in smart contracts—no board can change it, no investor can dilute it, no acquisition can override it.

**60% to charity. 30% infrastructure. 10% founder. Forever.**

He chose to maximize impact from day one rather than maximize personal gain.

That level of commitment to mission is rare in tech.

**What I'm using it for:**
� [SPECIFIC USE CASE 1]

That's the level of transparency I respect.

### VIDEO SCRIPT TEMPLATES (3 Formats)

#### 30-SECOND SCRIPT (TIKTOK/REELS)
"This AI company gives 60% of revenue to children's hospitals. Here's how it works:

You buy AI tools (chat assistant, automation, etc.), 60% of your payment goes to verified pediatric charities. Backend system enforces it. They've helped 396,000+ kids so far.

If you need AI tools anyway, might as well use ones that help kids. Link in bio."

#### 60-SECOND SCRIPT (YOUTUBE SHORTS/INSTAGRAM)
"So I found this tech company with a business model I've never seen before.

They're called FOR THE KIDS. They sell AI-powered business tools�chat assistants, automation, content creation.

But here's the twist: **60% of every dollar they make goes directly to verified pediatric charities**.

Not 'we'll contribute some profits eventually.' Not 'a portion goes to charity.' 60%. Of EVERY payment. And it's hardcoded into a blockchain smart contract.

They've already helped 396,000+ children.

I tested their tools for [DURATION], and they're actually good. So if you're in the market for AI stuff, might as well use ones that fund kids' healthcare.
