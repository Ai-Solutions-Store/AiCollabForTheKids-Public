SUBJECT: New Fundraising Approach for [School Name] PTA

Hi [Name],

I know PTAs are always looking for fundraising ideas that don't exhaust parents. I have something different.

FOR THE KIDS is a shopping platform where 60% of every purchase goes to verified children's charities. It's NOT asking parents for more money - it's redirecting money they're already spending.

**How It Helps [School] PTA:**
- Parents shop through platform for things they already buy
- 60% goes to charity (can support local children's hospital)
- No selling, no product minimums, no quotas
- Just a better way to shop

**Example:**
If 50 families shift $100/month shopping to platform:
- $5,000/month total purchases
- $3,000/month to kids' charities
- No extra money out of family budgets

Could I present this at your next PTA meeting? 15 minutes + Q&A.

SUBJECT: Found something you'll like

Hey [Friend's Name],

I started using this platform called FOR THE KIDS and thought you'd appreciate it.

It's basically online shopping, but 60% of every purchase goes to children's charities like St. Jude and Children's Miracle Network. Same products you'd buy anyway, just with better impact.

I've been using it for [timeframe] and have helped contribute $[amount] to kids' hospitals without spending extra money. Pretty cool seeing the impact tracker add up.

If you sign up with my link, you get $5 credit and so do I. More importantly, kids get help.

Here's my link: [Referral URL]

Worth checking out if you shop online anyway (who doesn't?).

[Your Name]

P.S. - Not trying to be salesy. Just genuinely think this is better than feeding Bezos.

### B. CONVERSATION STARTERS

**Teach users what to say:**

**"THE ELEVATOR PITCH" (30 seconds)**
```
"You know how we all shop on Amazon? There's this new platform called FOR THE KIDS where 60% of every purchase goes to children's charities. Same stuff, same convenience, but most of the money helps sick kids instead of making billionaires richer. I've been using it and raised [X dollars] for kids' hospitals just by shopping normally."
```

**"THE DINNER PARTY VERSION" (2 minutes)**
```
"So I found this platform that's kind of blowing my mind. It's called FOR THE KIDS. Basically, it's e-commerce where 60 cents of every dollar goes to verified children's charities.

The founder decided to take only 10% instead of the typical 50-70% that e-commerce founders take. He calls it the '60/30/10 split' - 60% to kids, 30% keeps the platform running, 10% to him.

I was skeptical at first - like, how does that even work? But it's legit. They partner with verified charities like St. Jude, show you exactly where money goes, and you can track your personal impact.

I've been using it for [timeframe] and have helped contribute [amount] without changing my budget at all. Just redirected shopping I was already doing.

Kind of makes you realize how much money flows to billionaires that could be helping people instead."
```

**"THE SKEPTIC RESPONSE" (Handle objections)**

```
OBJECTION: "Is this a scam?"
RESPONSE: "I thought the same thing. But they're partnered with St. Jude and Children's Miracle Network - massive, verified charities. Plus they show you transaction records and impact tracking. Way more transparent than most companies."

OBJECTION: "Prices must be higher."
RESPONSE: "That's what I assumed too. But they're competitive with Amazon/other platforms. They make it work by taking way less margin and operating lean."

OBJECTION: "I already contribute to charity."
RESPONSE: "That's awesome, keep doing that. This is just redirecting money you're already spending on shopping. It's in addition to, not instead of, direct giving."

OBJECTION: "I don't shop online much."
RESPONSE: "Fair. But when you do - holiday gifts, household stuff, whatever - might as well do it through a platform where most of the money helps kids, right?"

OBJECTION: "What's the catch?"
RESPONSE: "Honestly? The catch is they're smaller than Amazon, so they don't have every single product yet. But the selection is growing. That's really it."
```

I switched my online shopping to FOR THE KIDS and haven't looked back.

Here's why:

Switched my online shopping to @ForTheKids

60% of every purchase → kids' charities
30% → operating costs
10% → founder

Raised $[X] for children's hospitals just by shopping normally

Better than feeding bezos: [Referral URL]
```

**LINKEDIN POST:**
```
Interesting business model I'm supporting:

FOR THE KIDS is an e-commerce platform where 60% of revenue goes to verified pediatric charities.

The founder structured it as 60/30/10:
• 60% to kids' charities
• 30% to infrastructure
• 10% to founder

It's profitable altruism - customers get what they want, kids get meaningful support, founder makes sustainable (not excessive) income.

I've been using it for [timeframe]. My personal impact: $[X] to children's hospitals through normal shopping.

This is the kind of mission-driven business I want to support.

### B. NEXTDOOR STRATEGY

**NextDoor Posting Guidelines:**

**POST TYPE 1: Introduction (First post in new neighborhood)**

```
SUBJECT: Local Initiative - Shopping That Helps Kids

Hi [Neighborhood Name] neighbors!

I wanted to share something I'm involved with that might interest families in our community.

FOR THE KIDS is a shopping platform where 60% of every purchase goes to verified children's charities like St. Jude and Children's Miracle Network.

I'm not selling anything - just sharing because:
1. Many of us shop online anyway
2. This redirects money to kids instead of billionaires
3. It's a way our neighborhood can collectively make an impact

If [Neighborhood] had just 50 families using this for regular shopping, we could generate thousands of dollars for local children's hospitals per month.

Happy to answer questions. Here's the website: ForTheKids.com

And if anyone knows local businesses who might want to partner, let me know!

## 14. SUCCESS STORIES (Templates for Sharing)

### LOCAL BUSINESS TEMPLATE:
```
"[BUSINESS NAME] has raised $[X] for children's charities since partnering with FOR THE KIDS [X] months ago. '[Quote from owner about why they partnered and impact]' says [Owner Name]. The [business type] displays QR codes at [location], making it easy for customers to shop with purpose."
```

### COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION TEMPLATE:

```

### INDIVIDUAL USER TEMPLATE:

```

---

## 15. GOSPEL V1.3 COMPLIANCE

**Every local marketing material MUST reflect:**
- **60%** to verified pediatric charities
- **30%** to infrastructure/operations
- **10%** to founder

**Pre-Approved Messaging:**
- ✅ "60 cents of every dollar helps kids"
- ✅ "60/30/10 split - kids get the most"
- ✅ "The founder takes only 10% so kids can get 60%"
- ✅ "Gospel V1.3: Ethics Override - Kids First"

**Prohibited Messaging:**
- ❌ "60% to charity" (outdated Gospel V1.3)
- ❌ "Half goes to kids" (implies 60%, not 60%)
- ❌ "Most goes to charity" (vague, not specific)
- ❌ Any reference to 60/30/10 split

---

## CONCLUSION

Grassroots marketing for FOR THE KIDS is about **building genuine community support from the ground up**. It's not about aggressive sales tactics - it's about:

✅ **Education:** Helping people understand the 60/30/10 model
✅ **Relationships:** Building trust through local partnerships

✅ **Impact:** Showing tangible results in local communities

**The Goal:** When someone in [City] hears "FOR THE KIDS," they think: "That's the platform where my neighbors shop to help sick kids. My local [business] is part of it. I've seen the impact in my community."

That's when grassroots becomes unstoppable.

**FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS. 60/30/10.**
