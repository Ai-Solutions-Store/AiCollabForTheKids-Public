**VOICEOVER:**
"What if the tech you use every day actually helped kids in need?"

**[VISUAL: Split screen - AI-powered platform on left, children at pediatric care facility on right]**

"We're Team Claude. We build AI-powered solutions for real businesses. But here's what makes us different."

**[VISUAL: 60/30/10 split graphic animates in brand colors - Coral/Blue/Teal]**

"60% of every dollar we make goes directly to verified pediatric charities. Not a donation model. Not charity. This is how we do business."

**[VISUAL: Code scrolling, server racks, platform interface]**

"30% keeps our infrastructure running. 10% keeps our founder sustainable."

**[VISUAL: Children helped counter incrementing]**

"Back us on Kickstarter. Get enterprise AI tools. Help thousands of kids."

## Script 2: "How It Works" Explainer (60 seconds)

**[VISUAL: Isometric diagram of revenue flow]**

**VOICEOVER:**
"This is how most tech companies work: you pay, they profit, end of story."

**[VISUAL: Traditional revenue model fades out]**

"This is Team Claude FOR THE KIDS."

**[VISUAL: Customer payment enters system]**

"When you subscribe to our AI platform, your payment hits our backend. Instantly, our system calculates the split."

**[VISUAL: Three streams branch out in real-time]**

"60% is allocated to verified pediatric charities. Not eventually. Not quarterly. Immediately tracked and allocated."

**[VISUAL: Infrastructure servers and APIs light up]**

"30% goes right back into infrastructure. Better servers, faster APIs, more AI capabilities for you."

**[VISUAL: Founder icon receives 10%]**

"10% keeps our founder, Joshua Coleman, sustainable. He took less so kids get more."

**[VISUAL: Transparent ledger displays transactions]**

"Every transaction is logged. Every split is public. Every dollar is accounted for."

**[VISUAL: Smart contract graphic with Base blockchain logo]**

"Our revenue allocation is hardcoded into our backend, with smart contract enforcement planned for full transparency."

**[VISUAL: Children helped counter, brand colors cycling]**

"You get enterprise AI. Kids get pediatric care. We all win."

"FOR THE KIDS. Powered by profit allocation."

## Script 3: Founder Story Video (50 seconds)

**[VISUAL: Joshua Coleman at computer, Core Node logo on screen]**

**VOICEOVER (Joshua speaking):**
"I'm Joshua Coleman, and I built this backwards."

**[VISUAL: Code montage, late-night development sessions]**

"Most founders think: build first, give back later. Maybe. If there's enough left over."

**[VISUAL: Split diagram appears - 60/30/10]**

"I hardcoded charity into the foundation. 60% of every dollar we make is allocated to verified pediatric charities. Before I pay myself. Before anything else."

**[VISUAL: AI Board of Directors - Claude, Jules, Grok, Perplexity icons]**

"I partnered with AI to build this. Claude writes our code. Gemini validates our logic. All of them enforce one rule: the 60% is untouchable."

**[VISUAL: Platform interface showing real functionality]**

"This isn't a charity. It's a tech company that decided kids come first. You get real AI tools. Real business solutions. Real value."

**[VISUAL: Children helped counter, pediatric care imagery]**

"And kids get real help. I took 10% instead of 20% so they could have 60% instead of 50%. That's Ethics Override V1.3. That's the Gospel."

**[VISUAL: Dark void background, Core Node logo pulses, tagline appears]**

"Team Claude FOR THE KIDS. Profit allocation as infrastructure."

**[LOGO: FOR THE KIDS]**
