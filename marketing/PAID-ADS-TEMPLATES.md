## REDDIT ADS

### Reddit Ad #1: Tech Subreddits (Native Style)

**Title:** I built an AI platform where 60% goes to kids' charities. Here's what I learned about ethical business.

**Body Copy:**
Hey r/artificialintelligence,

I'm a dad who built AI tools. My daughters asked if my work helps anyone. That question kept me up at night.

So I did something probably stupid from a business perspective: I committed 60% of all revenue to verified pediatric charities. Not profits. Revenue.

The result? FOR THE KIDS - an AI platform that gives 60% to kids while providing the same features as ChatGPT Plus.

What I learned:
• Customers WANT ethical options (10K+ subscribers in 6 months)
• Transparency builds trust faster than marketing
• You can compete with Big Tech on ethics if not on funding
• Blockchain verification matters to skeptical audiences
• My daughters are proud of me now

Happy to answer questions about the business model, technical architecture, or why I'm terrible at capitalism.

**CTA:** Link in comments (seems organic)
**Target Subreddits:**
- r/artificialintelligence
- r/ChatGPT
- r/ArtificialInteligence
- r/technology
- r/Entrepreneur

**Budget:** $5-10/day
**Objective:** Traffic → Conversions

**A/B Test:**
- Founder story angle vs technical achievement angle
- Personal story vs business case study

### Reddit Ad #2: Parent/Family Subreddits

**Title:** Switched to AI that contributes 60% to kids' charities. Feels good to use tech that gives back.

**Body Copy:**
I was already paying $20/month for ChatGPT Plus. Then I found FOR THE KIDS.

Same price. Same AI features (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini). But 60% of my subscription goes to verified kids' charities.

As a parent, I love that I can show my kids that technology can help people. The platform has a live dashboard showing exactly where money goes - no greenwashing.

Last month my subscription funded:
- 30 meals for hungry kids
- 2.5 vaccines
- School supplies for 3 students

Not affiliated, just genuinely impressed a company actually walks the talk on ethics.

Their model: 60% to kids, 30% infrastructure, 10% founder. Founder literally took LESS so kids get MORE.

Link: [reddit-approved format]

**CTA:** "Check it out if you want AI with a conscience"
**Target Subreddits:**
- r/Parenting
- r/Mommit
- r/daddit
- r/Homeschool

**Budget:** $8-12/day
**Objective:** Conversions

**A/B Test:**
- Parent POV vs teacher POV

### Reddit Ad #3: Finance/Business Subreddits

**Title:** Business model analysis: AI startup gives 60% of revenue (not profit) to charity. Sustainable?

**Body Copy:**
Came across FOR THE KIDS - an AI platform that commits 60% of revenue to verified pediatric charities.

Not 60% of profits. 60% of REVENUE.

Business Model Breakdown:
- 60% → Verified 501(c)(3) kids' charities (blockchain-tracked)
- 30% → Infrastructure, servers, salaries, ops
- 10% → Founder

That leaves only 30% to run a tech company competing with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google.

The wild part? They're at 10K+ subscribers in 6 months and growing.

How is this sustainable?
• Low marginal cost (API access, not model training)
• High customer LTV (people don't churn from ethical products)
• Word-of-mouth marketing (60% charity is inherently shareable)
• Premium positioning ($19.99 vs $20 for ChatGPT Plus)

As someone who analyzes business models, I'm genuinely curious if this works long-term or if it's unsustainable altruism.

Thoughts?

**CTA:** Link in comments
**Target Subreddits:**
- r/Entrepreneur
- r/startups
- r/Business_Ideas
- r/investing
- r/Finance

**Budget:** $5-8/day
**Objective:** Engagement → Traffic

**A/B Test:**
- Skeptical analysis angle vs impressed analysis angle
- Focus on sustainability vs focus on growth metrics

**Competitor References:**
- Avoid direct comparisons in ad copy (can be flagged)
- Use "leading AI platforms" instead of "ChatGPT"
- Focus on your strengths, not their weaknesses
- Comparative charts OK in landing pages, not ads

**Medical/Health Claims:**
- No claims about treating/curing diseases

- "Healthcare professionals use..." is OK
