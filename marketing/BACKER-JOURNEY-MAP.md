# FOR THE KIDS - BACKER JOURNEY MAP
## Customer Experience Optimization Framework
## Gospel V1.3 Compliant: 60/30/10 Split (Kids/Infrastructure/Founder)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This journey map traces every touchpoint from first awareness to active advocacy, identifying emotional peaks, friction points, and optimization opportunities at each stage. Our goal: Convert awareness into action and action into advocacy.

**Key Insight:** The decision to give is emotional, but the action to give is rational. We must address both throughout the journey.
