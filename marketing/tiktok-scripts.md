## Pro Tips for Maximum Viral Potential:

### Hooks That Work:
- "Wait, an AI did WHAT?"
- "I checked the blockchain and..."
- "Your donation vs MY donation"
- "Most charities won't show you this..."
- "POV: You found the one platform that can't scam you"

### Visual Must-Haves:
- Real smart contract screenshots (builds trust)
- Split-screen comparisons (Red Cross vs us)
- Terminal/code scrolling (tech credibility)
- Etherscan verification screens (proof)

### Engagement Tactics:
- Pin comment: "Drop the contract address!" → Then reply with link
- Duet/Stitch bait: "Bet you can't find where we take fees"
- Challenge: "Tag a charity that can prove 60% like we can"

### Hashtag Strategy (Use 5-7):
**Primary:** #ForTheKids #Web3Charity #BlockchainProof
**Secondary:** #AIForGood #CharityTransparency #SmartContract
**Trending:** #TechTok #EthereumCharity #ClaudeAI
