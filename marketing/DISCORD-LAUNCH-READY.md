### 2.1 Primary Welcome Message for #welcome

**[PIN THIS IMMEDIATELY AFTER SERVER CREATION]**

---

- **60%** of FOR THE KIDS revenue ? verified 501(c)(3) pediatric charities

### 2.2 Gospel V1.3 Pinned Message for #gospel-v13

**[PIN THIS MESSAGE - REFERENCE MATERIAL ONLY]**

---

**Gospel V1.3: The Complete Framework (Immutable)**

**The Commitment:**
- **60%** of FOR THE KIDS revenue ? verified 501(c)(3) pediatric charities
- **30%** ? infrastructure, scaling, operations
- **10%** ? founder sustainability

**Why These Numbers?**

**60% to Charity (Maximum Impact):**
- Most nonprofits operate feast/famine; we provide predictable funding
- Pediatric care is underfunded relative to adult medicine
- Sustainable recurring revenue > sporadic revenue
- This is the maximum allocation possible while maintaining operations
- Competitors claim 50% aspirationally; we guarantee 60% contractually

**30% to Infrastructure (Sustainability Engine):**
- Servers, security, compliance, technical operations
- Product development and feature releases
- Team expansion and hiring
- Marketing and community growth
- Customer support and reliability
- Growth infrastructure enables growth impact

**10% to Founder (Preventing Burnout):**
- 80% of charity startups fail in year 3 due to founder burnout
- Zero allocation requires existing wealth (amplifies inequality)
- 10% is minimum viable amount for full-time focus
- Not extractive, not poverty wages, not unsustainable
- Sustainability beats sacrifice every time

**Why Gospel V1.3 is Immutable:**

1. **Smart Contract Enforcement** - Locked on blockchain (Base Mainnet: Planned (Q1 2026))
2. **Monthly Public Reporting** - Transparent allocation dashboard
3. **Quarterly Third-Party Audits** - Verified by independent auditors
4. **Community Governance** - You can propose improvements

**Gospel vs. Aspirational:**
- Aspirational: "We hope to give 60%"
- Gospel V1.3: "We cannot legally or technically give less than 60%"

**Questions or Challenges?**
Post in #general or #fundraising-ideas. The stronger our Gospel, the stronger our platform.

### 2.3 First-Week Community Message for #general

2. Why did you join FOR THE KIDS community?
3. What would you like to work on (if anything)?
4. What would make this community valuable to you?

No elevator pitch needed. Just genuine context.

```
60% ? Verified 501(c)(3) Pediatric Charities
30% ? Infrastructure, Scaling, Operations
10% ? Founder Sustainability
```

**This is:**
- Locked in smart contract (Planned (Q1 2026))
- Verified quarterly by third-party auditors
- Governed by community input
- The foundation of everything we do

**In Discord, enforce this by:**
1. Every announcement references "60%" not "50%"
2. Every Gospel discussion points to #gospel-v13
3. Every impact report verifies the allocation
4. Every community challenge celebrates Gospel compliance
5. Every crisis response protects Gospel V1.3
