# FOR THE KIDS Community Guidelines
**Version 1.0 | Effective: December 19, 2025**

---

## Welcome to the FOR THE KIDS Community

This community exists to support a single, unwavering mission: **helping children at Verified Pediatric Charities** through transparent, technology-driven profit allocation.

These guidelines ensure our community remains focused, respectful, and aligned with our Gospel V1.3 principles.

---

## Our Mission & Values

### The Sacred Covenant
Every dollar of revenue generated through this platform is automatically allocated according to Gospel V1.3:

```
60% → Verified Pediatric Charities
30% → Infrastructure & Reinvestment
10% → Founder (Joshua Coleman)
```

**This split is immutable and cannot be changed by anyone.**

### Core Values
1. **Children First** - Every decision prioritizes impact for kids
2. **Radical Transparency** - All profit allocation is tracked and visible
3. **Technology-Driven** - We use AI and blockchain for trustless execution
4. **Professional Excellence** - We operate like a serious tech firm (Vercel/Datadog aesthetic)
5. **Community-Powered** - We grow through authentic engagement, not manipulation

---

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What is FOR THE KIDS?**
A: A for-profit tech platform that automatically allocates 60% of all revenue to Verified Pediatric Charities, using AI and blockchain for transparent, trustless execution.

**Q: Can I get a tax deduction for purchases?**
A: No. Since this is not a charity and you're purchasing products/services (not donating), purchases are not tax-deductible.

A: Consistently contribute value, help others, maintain Gospel compliance, and demonstrate mission alignment. Moderators track contributions and promote members.
