## FINAL THOUGHTS

The running community is built on grit, determination, and heart. Runners understand what it means to push yourself, to overcome challenges, to go the distance.

Kids facing medical hardship need that same determination. They need our distance. They need our heart.

This campaign positions FOR THE KIDS not as another charity, but as a movement where athletes' passion becomes pediatric healthcare funding. Every marathon finish. Every 5K. Every training run. Every virtual race.

It all counts.

**Runners go the distance for kids. FOR THE KIDS.**
