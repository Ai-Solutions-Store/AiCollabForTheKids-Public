## 11. AMAZON SMILE ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES

### Platform Overview
Amazon Smile (closing December 2024) previously contributed 0.5% to charities. We need alternative strategies for Amazon ecosystem users.

### Strategy 1: AmazonSmile Successor (Benevity Platform)

**What Happened:**
- Amazon Smile shut down December 31, 2024
- Replaced with "Amazon Chariable Giving Platform" (coming 2025)
- New platform will use Benevity as processor

**Action Items (When Platform Launches):**
1. Register FOR THE KIDS (or partner nonprofit) on Benevity
2. Create campaign highlighting pediatric focus
3. Advertise alternative to customers

**Expected Impact:**
- Smaller than Amazon Smile (fewer customers will migrate)
- Estimated: $2,000-$5,000/month (vs. $15,000 with Smile)

### Strategy 2: Amazon Affiliate Program contribution

**Model:**
```
Customer buys via Amazon
+- FOR THE KIDS affiliate link earns 4-7% commission
   +- 60% of commission to pediatric charities
```

**Implementation:**
1. Join Amazon Associates program
2. Create "Shop with Purpose" section on website
3. Feature 50+ recommended items (books, toys, medical supplies)
4. Track affiliate commissions
5. Monthly report showing commission-to-charity revenue flow

**Marketing Message:**
```
"Shop Amazon through our link. We earn 4% commission.
60% of that goes to pediatric charities.
You pay nothing extra. Kids benefit."
```

**Projected Impact:**

### Platform Synergy Effects

**Why Multiple Platforms Matter:**

1. **Redundancy:** If one platform changes policy (Amazon Smile), others sustain revenue
2. **Audience Diversity:** Each platform reaches different demographics
3. **Viral Amplification:** Cross-platform sharing increases reach
4. **Supporter Fatigue Prevention:** Multiple giving options prevent "contribution exhaustion"
5. **International Expansion:** GlobalGiving/JustGiving reach global supporters
6. **Corporate Access:** MightyCause reaches 30M+ employees
7. **Passive Income:** Amazon/eBay require no marketing to sustain

**Cross-Platform Content:**
- Monthly impact story written once, published on all 12 platforms
- Video content: 30-second version for social, 2-minute for website, 10-minute for YouTube
- Supporter testimonials: Collected once, repurposed everywhere
- Hospital partnerships: Feature same partners across all channels

## GOSPEL COMPLIANCE: LANGUAGE STANDARDS

All copy across all platforms MUST follow Gospel V1.3 terminology:

**APPROVED LANGUAGE:**
- ? "60% to pediatric charities" (revenue allocation model)
- ? "Profit allocation" (not "treasury")
- ? "Revenue split" (not "charity payout")
- ? "Customer purchase" or "supporter contribution" (not "supporter gift")
- ? "Beneficiary allocation" (not "beneficiary allocation")
- ? "FOR THE KIDS platform" (not "FOR THE KIDS charity")
- ? "Supporter" or "backer" or "customer" (not "supporter")
- ? "Contribution" or "purchase" or "revenue" (not "contribution")

**FORBIDDEN LANGUAGE:**
- ? "revenue allocation" (use "contribution" where applicable)
- ? "treasury allocation"
- ? "Charity contribution fund"
- ? "supporter wall" (use "Supporter wall")
- ? "contribute" (use "support," "contribute," or "purchase")
- ? "contribution" (use "contribution," "purchase," or "revenue")
- ? "supporter" (use "supporter," "backer," or "customer")
- ? "Gospel V1.3" (outdated)
- ? "60% allocation" (old split)
- ? "20% to founder" (old split)

**Reason:** FOR THE KIDS is a profit-allocation platform, NOT a charity. It's a for-profit LLC that allocates profit, which is different from a traditional charity receiving contributions.
