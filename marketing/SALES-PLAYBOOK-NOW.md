### ROI Calculation Framework

#### For Enterprise Customers

**Scenario: $100,000/year contract**

```
TRADITIONAL VENDOR:
$100,000 → Vendor profit
$0 → Social impact
$15,000 → Separate CSR donation (if they remember)
= $115,000 total spend for AI + some impact

FOR THE KIDS:
$100,000 → Contract
$60,000 → Automatic allocation to pediatric charities
$0 → Additional CSR budget needed
= $100,000 total spend for AI + guaranteed impact
```

**Net Savings:** $15,000/year in CSR budget
**Impact Multiplier:** 4x more charitable allocation than typical corporate giving
**PR Value:** Estimated $50,000+ in earned media coverage

---

### Key Messaging by Buyer Persona

#### CTO/VP Engineering
**Message:** "Multi-model AI orchestration with production-ready APIs. No vendor lock-in. Full control."
**Pain Point:** Avoiding single-vendor dependency, need for flexibility

#### CFO/Finance
**Message:** "Replace two line items (AI vendor + CSR donation) with one. Same budget, double the impact."
**Pain Point:** Budget consolidation, ROI justification
**Proof Point:** "Average enterprise saves $15,000/year by consolidating AI + philanthropy spend."

#### CMO/Marketing
**Message:** "Every customer interaction powered by AI that helps children. Built-in brand story."
**Pain Point:** Differentiation, customer loyalty, purpose-driven marketing
**Proof Point:** "Our customers' NPS increases 12 points when they learn their purchases fund pediatric care."

## 2. DISCOVERY CALL SCRIPT

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes
**Goal:** Qualify the prospect, identify pain points, schedule demo
**Required Tools:** CRM (log everything), video conferencing, screen share capability

---

### Pre-Call Preparation (15 minutes)

**Research Checklist:**
- [ ] Review company website and recent news
- [ ] Check LinkedIn for decision-makers
- [ ] Identify existing AI vendors (if public)
- [ ] Note any CSR/ESG initiatives
- [ ] Review their Glassdoor/employee reviews (culture fit)
- [ ] Prepare 3 custom talking points based on their industry

---

### Opening (2 minutes)

**Script:**

> "Hi [Name], thanks for joining. I'm [Your Name] from FOR THE KIDS. Before we dive in, I want to set expectations: This isn't a sales pitch. My goal is to understand if we're a fit for your AI and ESG goals. If we're not, I'll tell you. Sound good?"

**Why this works:** Disarms defensiveness, positions you as consultant vs. salesperson.

---

### Discovery Questions (20 minutes)

**SECTION 1: Current AI Usage**

**Q1:** "Are you currently using any AI solutions in your business? Which ones?"
**Listen for:** OpenAI, Google, Azure, in-house models, "exploring AI"
**Red Flag:** "We tried AI and it didn't work" = needs education, not ready
**Green Flag:** "We use multiple AI vendors" = pain point we can solve

**Q2:** "What's working well with your current setup? What's frustrating?"
**Listen for:** Vendor lock-in complaints, cost concerns, compliance issues
**Follow-up:** "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing, what would it be?"

**Q3:** "How are you handling age-gating or content safety? Especially if you serve families?"
**Listen for:** COPPA concerns, manual moderation, fear of lawsuits
**Value Prop Trigger:** "We have built-in COPPA-compliant age-gating. It's automatic."

---

**SECTION 2: ESG/CSR Landscape**

**Q4:** "Does your company have ESG goals or a corporate giving program?"
**Listen for:** "Yes, we donate X% of revenue" or "Board wants us to do more"
**Red Flag:** "We don't believe in that stuff" = culture misalignment, move on
**Green Flag:** "Yes, but it's hard to track/prove impact" = perfect fit

**Q5:** "Who owns the CSR budget? Is it separate from technology spend?"
**Listen for:** Budget consolidation opportunity
**Value Prop Trigger:** "What if your AI spend automatically counted as CSR impact?"

**Q6:** "How do you currently report ESG impact to stakeholders?"
**Listen for:** Manual spreadsheets, third-party consultants (expensive)
**Value Prop Trigger:** "We generate quarterly impact reports automatically. No extra work."

---

**SECTION 3: Pain Points & Priorities**

**Q7:** "What would make your life easier in the next 6 months?"
**Listen for:** Hiring challenges, customer retention, regulatory compliance
**Note:** Map their answer to our value props

**Q8:** "If you could tell your CEO one thing about your team's impact, what would it be?"
**Listen for:** Desire to be seen as strategic, not just cost center
**Value Prop Trigger:** "Imagine telling your CEO: 'Our AI stack funded 500 pediatric treatments this quarter.'"

**Q9:** "What's your timeline for making a decision on new vendors?"
**Listen for:** "Evaluating now" (hot) vs. "Maybe next year" (nurture)
**Qualify:** Budget cycle, approval process, decision-makers involved

---

### Transition to Demo Scheduling (5 minutes)

**Script:**

> "Based on what you've shared, I think there's a strong fit here. Specifically, I heard you say [pain point 1], [pain point 2], and [pain point 3]. I'd love to show you how we solve those in a 30-minute demo.
>
> Fair warning: I'm going to show you our profit allocation model. 60% of what you pay goes to verified pediatric charities. It's baked into the platform. If that makes you uncomfortable, let's not waste each other's time. But if that excites you, you're going to love this."

**Listen for:**
- **"That's amazing!"** = schedule demo immediately
- **"How does that even work?"** = curiosity, good sign
- **"We can't do charity stuff"** = probe deeper, might be a misunderstanding
- **"I need to talk to my boss"** = add boss to demo invite

---

### Closing the Discovery Call (3 minutes)

**Action Items Checklist:**

- [ ] Send follow-up email with:
  - Recap of their pain points
  - Link to case study (if relevant industry)

**Script:**

> "Great! I'm sending you a calendar invite for [Date/Time]. In the meantime, I'll email you a one-pager on how the 60% allocation works. Any questions before we hang up?"

---

## 3. DEMO SCRIPT (30-Minute Walkthrough)

**Duration:** 30 minutes (strict)
**Goal:** Show platform value, address pain points, get verbal commitment to next step
**Setup:** Screen share ready, demo environment pre-loaded, backup plan if tech fails

---

### Pre-Demo Checklist (Do This 1 Hour Before)

- [ ] Test demo environment (make sure it's live)
- [ ] Customize demo with their company name/logo (if possible)
- [ ] Prepare 3 personalized examples based on discovery call
- [ ] Have proposal template ready to share at end
- [ ] Set up screen recording (for internal review)
- [ ] Silence all notifications

---

### Demo Structure (30 Minutes)

#### SEGMENT 1: Re-Anchor Expectations (2 minutes)

**Script:**

> "Thanks for joining, [Name]. Quick agenda:
> - First 5 minutes: I'll show you the platform
> - Next 15 minutes: We'll walk through how it solves [their pain points]
> - Last 10 minutes: Q&A and discuss next steps
>
> I'm going to move fast. Stop me anytime with questions. Sound good?"

**Why this works:** Sets the pace, gives them permission to interrupt, respects their time.

---

#### SEGMENT 2: The Hook - Profit Allocation Dashboard (5 minutes)

**OPEN WITH THE IMPACT DASHBOARD (NOT THE PRODUCT)**

**Script:**

> "Before I show you any AI features, I want to show you what makes us different. This is our Impact Dashboard. [Share screen]
>
> See this number? [Point to charity allocation total] That's $1.2 million allocated to pediatric charities this year. Every customer sees their contribution here.
>
> Your company spends [estimated amount] on AI annually. If you spent that with us, [calculated 60%] would automatically go to verified pediatric charities. No extra work. No separate donations. Built into your invoice.
>
> Questions on this before I show you the tech?"

**Why this works:** Leads with differentiation. They've never seen this before. Creates emotional buy-in BEFORE feature details.

---

#### SEGMENT 3: Platform Walkthrough (15 minutes)

**Show Features in This Order (Customized to Their Pain Points):**

**FEATURE 1: Multi-Model AI Orchestration (3 minutes)**

**Script:**

> "Now, the tech. You mentioned you're using [their current vendor]. Here's the problem with single-vendor AI: You're locked in.
>
> Watch this. [Demonstrate switching between Claude, Gemini, Grok]
>
> Same prompt, different models. Claude is best for code. Gemini is best for business logic. Grok is fastest for simple tasks. You choose. No vendor lock-in.
>
> Your team can switch models with one API parameter. Try doing that with OpenAI Enterprise."

**Why this works:** Solves vendor lock-in pain point with visual proof.

---

**FEATURE 2: Age-Gating & Compliance (3 minutes - if relevant)**

**Script:**

> "You mentioned [COPPA concerns / serving families]. This is automatic. [Show age verification flow]
>
> Under 18? They get Baby Grok (kid-safe AI).
> Over 18? They get Grok 4 (full capabilities).
>
> We're COPPA and FOSTA compliant out of the box. No configuration needed. Most companies spend $50K on legal reviews to build this. You get it included."

**Why this works:** Shows massive cost savings on compliance.

---

**FEATURE 3: White-Label Deployment (3 minutes)**

**Script:**

> "Here's where it gets fun. Everything I'm showing you can be white-labeled. [Show example with their logo/colors]
>
> Your customers see YOUR brand. We're invisible. But 60% still goes to charity.
>
> Imagine your checkout page: 'Powered by [Their Company] AI. 60% of profits help children.' That's your competitive advantage."

**Why this works:** Shows them how to monetize the platform, not just use it.

---

**FEATURE 4: API Documentation & Integration (3 minutes)**

**Script:**

> "Your engineers are going to love this. [Show API docs]
>
> RESTful API. Full documentation. Production-ready. We have clients integrated in 48 hours.
>
> You mentioned [integration pain point]. Here's how we solve it: [Show specific endpoint]
>
> Want me to send this to your dev team? I can set up a technical Q&A call."

**Why this works:** Addresses technical buyer concerns, offers next step.

---

**FEATURE 5: ESG Reporting Dashboard (3 minutes)**

**Script:**

> "Last thing. Your CSR team is going to kiss you for this. [Show ESG dashboard]
>
> Every quarter, you get this report:
> - Total allocation: $X
> - Children helped: Y
> - Treatments funded: Z
> - Partner charities: [List]
>
> You can share this with your board, investors, customers. It's automatic. No spreadsheets. No consultants.
>
> How much are you spending on ESG reporting right now?"

**Why this works:** Quantifies time savings, positions you as strategic partner.

---

#### SEGMENT 4: Q&A & Next Steps (8 minutes)

**Transition Script:**

> "That's the platform. Before I answer questions, let me ask you: On a scale of 1-10, how excited are you about this?"

**Listen for:**
- **8-10:** "Great! Let's talk contract terms."
- **5-7:** "What would make this a 10?" (Handle objections)
- **1-4:** "What didn't resonate?" (Qualify out or pivot)

---

**Close for Next Step:**

**Script:**

> "Here's what I propose: I'll send you a formal proposal today with three pricing tiers. You review it with [decision-makers]. We'll schedule a 30-minute call this week to finalize terms. If we're aligned, we can have you live in 2 weeks. Does that timeline work?"

**Get Verbal Commitment:**
- [ ] They agree to review proposal by [specific date]
- [ ] They commit to decision-maker review meeting
- [ ] They share any final concerns NOW (don't let them hide objections)

## 4. OBJECTION HANDLING (15 Common Objections)

**Framework:** Feel, Felt, Found Method + Proof

---

### OBJECTION 1: "This sounds like charity. We're a for-profit business."

**Response:**

> "I hear you. And you're right - we're NOT a charity. We're a for-profit AI platform. Here's the difference:
>
> When you buy from AWS, 100% of your payment goes to Amazon shareholders. When you buy from us, 60% goes to verified pediatric charities as a structural profit allocation. You're still buying AI services. The charity part is OUR business model, not yours.
>
> Think of it like TOMS Shoes. You buy shoes. They donate shoes. You're still just buying shoes.
>
> Does that distinction make sense?"

**Proof Point:** "We have 50+ for-profit enterprise clients. None of them classify this as a donation. It's a vendor payment."

---

### OBJECTION 2: "We already have an AI vendor (OpenAI/Google/Azure)."

**Response:**

> "Great! Most of our clients do. Here's the question: Are you locked into one model?
>
> What happens when GPT-5 isn't the best at [their use case]? Or when Google releases something better? You're stuck renegotiating contracts, retraining teams, rewriting code.
>
> We let you use ALL the major models - Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity - with one API. You can switch models per task. No vendor lock-in.
>
> Plus, 60% of what you pay helps children. Your current vendor can't say that."

**Proof Point:** "We have clients who REPLACED OpenAI and clients who USE US ALONGSIDE OpenAI. Both work."

---

### OBJECTION 3: "How do I know the 60% actually goes to charity?"

**Response:**

> "That's a smart question. Here's how we prove it:
>
> 1. **Transparent Ledger:** Every transaction is logged. You get quarterly reports showing your exact allocation.
> 2. **Third-Party Verification:** We're working with [Charity Navigator / GiveWell] to audit our allocations.
> 3. **Blockchain-Ready:** We're building smart contract proof (optional, but available).
>
> Also, here's the thing: If we DIDN'T allocate 60%, we'd be committing fraud. Our entire business model would collapse. We have more to lose than you do.
>
> Want to talk to one of our existing customers about their experience?"

**Proof Point:** Share customer testimonial or connect them with a reference client.

---

### OBJECTION 4: "This is too expensive."

**Response:**

> "Compared to what? Let's do the math:
>
> Right now, you're paying [current vendor] $X/year for AI. SEPARATELY, you're probably donating $Y/year to charity (or your board WANTS you to).
>
> Total: $X + $Y.
>
> With us, you pay $X (same AI budget), but $0.60X automatically goes to charity. You're CONSOLIDATING two line items.
>
> Net result: You SAVE money and INCREASE impact. Where's the downside?"

**Proof Point:** "Our average enterprise client saves $15,000/year by consolidating AI + CSR budgets."

---

### OBJECTION 5: "We need to run this by legal/compliance."

**Response:**

> "Absolutely. We expect that. Here's what I'll send you TODAY:
>
> 1. **Legal FAQ:** Addresses tax implications, vendor classification, data privacy
> 2. **Sample Contract:** Your legal team can review before we even talk pricing
> 3. **COPPA/FOSTA Compliance Docs:** If relevant to your industry
>
> Most legal reviews take 2 weeks. I'll check in with you next [specific date]. Does that work?"

**Proof Point:** "We've passed legal review at [name Fortune 500 client if you have one]. Happy to connect your legal team with theirs."

---

### OBJECTION 6: "What if we don't want to publicize our charity involvement?"

**Response:**

> "Totally fine. You control the narrative. Here are your options:
>
> 1. **Publicize It:** Use it in marketing, PR, recruiting. ('We work with AI platforms that help children.')
> 2. **Keep It Internal:** Share impact reports with employees only (great for culture).
> 3. **Stay Silent:** Don't mention it at all. You still get the impact, just quietly.
>
> We're not going to announce your partnership without permission. This is YOUR story to tell - or not."

**Proof Point:** "We have clients doing all three approaches. All are happy."

---

### OBJECTION 7: "We want to choose which charities our money goes to."

**Response:**

> "I totally understand. Here's how we handle that:
>
> Our 60% goes to a pool of VERIFIED pediatric charities (St. Jude, Children's Hospital Network, etc.). We vet them using [Charity Navigator ratings / GiveWell methodology].
>
> You don't choose individual charities, BUT you get impact reports showing WHERE your allocation went.
>
> Here's why we do it this way: If every client picked their own charity, we'd have 500 different donation streams. The overhead would eat into the 60%. This way, 100% of the 60% reaches children.
>
> That said, if you have a SPECIFIC pediatric charity you're passionate about, let's talk. For enterprise contracts, we can explore custom allocations."

**Proof Point:** "Our charity partners have a 95%+ efficiency rating. Your money reaches kids, not admin overhead."

---

### OBJECTION 8: "What about data privacy? Are you selling our data to fund charity?"

**Response:**

> "Great question. Short answer: NO. We don't sell data. Ever.
>
> The 60% comes from YOUR PAYMENT, not from monetizing your data. You pay us $100. We allocate $60 to charity, $30 to infrastructure, $10 to our founder. That's it.
>
> We're SOC 2 Type II compliant (in progress). We're GDPR compliant. We're COPPA compliant. Your data is YOUR data.
>
> Want to see our data privacy policy? I'll send it over right now."

**Proof Point:** Share security certifications, privacy policy, third-party audit results.

---

### OBJECTION 9: "How is this different from donating 60% ourselves?"

**Response:**

> "You COULD donate 60% yourself. Here's why you won't:
>
> 1. **You'll Forget:** CSR budgets get cut. AI budgets don't. This guarantees the allocation.
> 2. **Administrative Overhead:** You'd need to research charities, vet them, process donations, generate reports. We do all that.
> 3. **Tax Complexity:** Donating 60% of revenue creates tax paperwork. Paying us is a vendor expense. Cleaner.
> 4. **Brand Story:** 'We use AI that helps children' is better than 'We also donate sometimes.'
>
> You're paying for convenience, consistency, and a better story."

**Proof Point:** "Our clients tried donating separately. It didn't stick. This does."

---

### OBJECTION 10: "We need to start small. Can we do a pilot?"

**Response:**

> "Absolutely. Here's our pilot structure:
>
> **3-Month Pilot:**
> - $5,000/month (standard pricing)
> - Full platform access (not a limited demo)
> - Dedicated onboarding engineer
> - Quarterly impact report at end
>
> At month 3, you decide: Scale up, stay at pilot level, or part ways. No penalties.
>
> Does that reduce your risk enough to move forward?"

**Proof Point:** "80% of our pilots convert to full contracts. The platform sells itself once you use it."

---

### OBJECTION 11: "Our CEO doesn't believe in mixing business with charity."

**Response:**

> "I respect that philosophy. Here's a different way to frame it:
>
> This isn't charity. This is RISK MITIGATION.
>
> Companies with strong ESG profiles:
> - Attract better talent (23% higher retention)
> - Get better customer loyalty (12-point NPS increase)
> - Receive favorable media coverage (3x more mentions)
> - Face fewer regulatory penalties
>
> The 60% allocation isn't philanthropy. It's a strategic investment in brand resilience.
>
> Would your CEO take a call with me to discuss?"

**Proof Point:** Share McKinsey ESG report, Deloitte CSR study, or similar third-party research.

---

### OBJECTION 12: "What if you go out of business? We can't rely on a startup."

**Response:**

> "Fair concern. Here's our stability story:
>
> 1. **Infrastructure:** We own our hardware. 184GB RAM bare metal cluster. We're not dependent on cloud credits running out.
> 2. **Revenue Model:** 30% of every transaction goes to infrastructure. We're self-sustaining.
> 3. **Open Source Commitment:** If we shut down, we'll open-source the platform. Your integrations won't break.
> 4. **Founder Commitment:** Our founder (Joshua Coleman) built this as a 10-year mission, not a flip-and-exit startup.
>
> Also, worst case: You switch vendors. Same as if AWS shut down (unlikely, but possible).
>
> Want to see our financials? We can share revenue growth metrics under NDA."

**Proof Point:** Share growth metrics, client retention rate (if strong), or founder background.

---

### OBJECTION 13: "We don't serve children. Why would we support pediatric charities?"

**Response:**

> "You don't have to serve children to support them. Here's the reframe:
>
> Every company has employees with children. Customers with children. Investors with children.
>
> When you tell your team, 'Our AI platform funds pediatric cancer treatment,' you're showing them the company has values beyond profit.
>
> Plus, pediatric charities have ZERO political baggage. Supporting children's health is universally respected. No controversy.
>
> That said, if you're passionate about a different cause, let's talk. For enterprise contracts, we can explore custom allocations."

**Proof Point:** Share employee satisfaction data from companies with strong CSR programs.

---

### OBJECTION 14: "Can we negotiate the 60/30/10 split?"

**Response:**

> "No. And here's why:
>
> The 60/30/10 split is HARDCODED into our platform. It's in our smart contracts (blockchain-enforced). Our founder gave up 10% of his earnings to increase the charity allocation from 50% to 60%.
>
> If we let clients negotiate the split, it's no longer a guarantee. It becomes a 'sometimes we help kids' model. That defeats the mission.
>
> What you CAN negotiate:
> - Pricing per transaction
> - Volume discounts
> - Custom integrations
> - White-label branding
>
> But the 60/30/10 split? That's immutable. It's our Gospel."

**Proof Point:** Share the Gospel document excerpt (Rule #2: 60/30/10 Profit Allocation Is Immutable).

---

### OBJECTION 15: "This sounds too good to be true."

**Response:**

> "I get that. Most AI vendors don't allocate 60% to charity. Here's why WE do:
>
> Our founder (Joshua Coleman) built this platform after losing a family member to pediatric illness. He could have kept 100% of profits. Instead, he hardcoded 60% to charity and 10% to himself.
>
> This isn't a marketing gimmick. It's the CORE BUSINESS MODEL. If we stopped allocating 60%, the platform would shut down. It's that fundamental.
>
> Want proof? Talk to our existing customers. Read our quarterly impact reports. Check our open-source code. We're radically transparent.
>
> What specific part seems too good to be true? Let's address it."

**Proof Point:** Offer to connect them with a reference client OR walk them through the tech stack on GitHub.

**END OF PROPOSAL**

## 6. CONTRACT NEGOTIATION GUIDELINES

**Goal:** Close the deal while protecting company interests and maintaining Gospel compliance (60/30/10 split is NON-NEGOTIABLE).

---

### Pre-Negotiation Preparation

**Know Your Limits:**

**NEGOTIABLE:**
- Pricing (volume discounts, annual prepay discounts)
- Payment terms (Net 30 vs. Net 60)
- Contract length (6 months vs. 12 months vs. multi-year)
- Custom integrations (additional engineering work)
- White-label customization depth
- Support SLA tiers

**NON-NEGOTIABLE (Gospel Rules):**
- 60/30/10 profit allocation split
- Charity partner selection (must be verified pediatric charities)
- Data privacy standards (COPPA/GDPR compliance)
- Claude-only code modifications (if they want custom features)

---

### Common Negotiation Scenarios

#### SCENARIO 1: "Can you lower the price?"

**Response Framework:**

> "I understand budget constraints. Here are your options:
>
> **Option 1: Annual Prepayment Discount**
> Pay upfront for 12 months, get 10% off. (Growth tier drops from $180K to $162K)
>
> **Option 2: Start with Startup Tier**
> Begin at $5K/month, scale up when you see ROI.
>
> **Option 3: Volume Commitment**
> Commit to 24 months, get 15% off year 2.
>
> What I CAN'T do: Reduce the price without reducing service. We're a mission-driven company. 60% goes to charity. Slashing prices means slashing impact.
>
> Which option works best for your budget?"

**DON'T:**
- Offer discounts larger than 15% (erodes margins, violates Gospel economics)
- Agree to "just this once" exceptions (sets bad precedent)

---

#### SCENARIO 2: "We need Net 60 payment terms."

**Response Framework:**

> "We can do Net 60 if you meet one of these conditions:
>
> **Option 1:** Annual prepayment (eliminates cash flow concern)
> **Option 2:** Net 60 with 5% higher pricing (compensates for our financing cost)
> **Option 3:** Start with Net 30, move to Net 60 after 6 months of on-time payments
>
> Our preference: Net 30. Our infrastructure costs (servers, APIs) are paid upfront. Net 60 creates cash flow challenges.
>
> Can you work with Net 30?"

**DON'T:**
- Agree to Net 60+ without compensation (hurts cash flow)
- Accept "pay when paid" clauses (too risky)

---

#### SCENARIO 3: "Can we negotiate the 60% charity allocation?"

**Response Framework:**

> "No. Here's why:
>
> The 60/30/10 split is hardcoded into our platform. It's in our smart contracts. It's in our Gospel document. Our founder gave up income to INCREASE the charity allocation from 50% to 60%.
>
> If I let you negotiate it, I'd have to let every client negotiate it. Then it's not a guarantee anymore. It's a 'sometimes we help kids' model. That defeats the mission.
>
> What you CAN negotiate:
> - Which tier you choose (Startup vs. Growth vs. Enterprise)
> - Payment terms (Net 30 vs. prepay for discount)
> - Custom integrations (we can scope additional work)
>
> But the 60%? That's immutable. Would you ask TOMS Shoes to donate fewer shoes?"

**DON'T:**
- Budge on this. Ever. Gospel Rule #2 is absolute.

---

#### SCENARIO 4: "We want to choose our own charity partner."

**Response Framework:**

> "I appreciate your passion for a specific charity. Here's how we handle this:
>
> **Standard Tier (All Clients):**
> 60% goes to our pool of verified pediatric charities (St. Jude, Children's Hospital Network, etc.). You get quarterly reports showing WHERE your allocation went.
>
> **Enterprise Tier (Custom Option):**
> If you're spending $50K+/month, we can explore allocating YOUR 60% to a specific pediatric charity (if it meets our vetting criteria).
>
> **Why We Do It This Way:**
> If every client picked a different charity, we'd have 500 donation streams. The admin overhead would eat into the 60%. This way, 100% of the 60% reaches children.
>
> Is there a specific pediatric charity you're passionate about? Let's see if we can include it in our verified partner list."

**DON'T:**
- Allow non-pediatric charities (violates Gospel mission)
- Allow charities with low efficiency ratings (<90% on Charity Navigator)

---

#### SCENARIO 5: "We need a 6-month pilot, not 12 months."

**Response Framework:**

> "We can do a 6-month pilot. Here's the structure:
>
> **Option 1: Standard Pilot**
> 6 months at full price ($90K for Growth tier). At month 6, you decide: renew for 12 months or part ways. No penalty.
>
> **Option 2: Pilot-to-Contract**
> 3 months at full price ($45K for Growth tier). If you convert to 12-month contract at month 3, we credit the 3-month cost toward year 1. (Effectively a free trial if you convert.)
>
> **What I Can't Do:** Offer month-to-month. Our onboarding costs are high (dedicated engineer, custom integration). We need minimum 6-month commitment to break even.
>
> Which option reduces your risk enough to move forward?"

**DON'T:**
- Agree to month-to-month (too much churn risk)
- Offer pilots below 3 months (doesn't give enough time to see value)

---

#### SCENARIO 6: "We want to own the code / get source access."

**Response Framework:**

> "I understand the concern about vendor lock-in. Here's what we can offer:
>
> **Option 1: API Ownership (All Tiers)**
> You own your API keys, your data, your integrations. If you leave, you take everything with you. You're not locked in.
>
> **Option 2: Escrow Agreement (Enterprise Tier)**
> We place source code in escrow. If we go out of business or fail to support you, you get access to the code. You continue running the platform.
>
> **Option 3: Open Source Commitment**
> If we shut down, we'll open-source the platform. You won't lose your integrations.
>
> **What I Can't Do:** Give you source code upfront. Our IP is our moat. But we'll protect your business continuity through escrow.
>
> Does an escrow agreement solve your concern?"

**DON'T:**
- Give away source code (destroys IP value)
- Ignore their valid concern about vendor lock-in (offer alternatives)

---

### Negotiation Tactics & Best Practices

#### TACTIC 1: Anchor High, Concede Slowly

**Example:**
- **Them:** "Can you do $10K/month instead of $15K?"
- **You:** "Our standard rate is $15K. I could do $14K if you prepay annually. Or $13.5K if you commit to 24 months. What works better?"

**Why It Works:** Small concessions feel like wins. They get a deal, you protect margin.

---

#### TACTIC 2: Trade, Don't Give

**Example:**
- **Them:** "Can you throw in free custom integration?"
- **You:** "I can include 20 hours of custom integration if you upgrade to Enterprise tier. Or I can scope it as a separate project at $200/hour. Which do you prefer?"

**Why It Works:** Never give without getting. Maintain value exchange.

---

#### TACTIC 3: Use Silence

**Example:**
- **You:** "The price is $15K/month."
- **Them:** "That's too high."
- **You:** [Silence. Count to 10.]
- **Them:** "What if we did $12K?"
- **You:** "I can't go that low. Best I can do is $14K with annual prepay."

**Why It Works:** Whoever speaks first after a price objection usually concedes.

---

#### TACTIC 4: "Higher Authority" Blocker

**Example:**
- **Them:** "Can you reduce the charity allocation to 40%?"
- **You:** "I don't have authority to change that. It's hardcoded in our Gospel document. Our founder and board would have to approve, and they've explicitly said it's immutable. Is there another way I can help you hit your budget?"

**Why It Works:** Takes pressure off you. Blames "the system" instead of being stubborn.

---

#### TACTIC 5: "Split the Difference" Close

**Example:**
- **Them:** "We can only do $10K/month."
- **You:** "Our floor is $15K."
- **Them:** "Meet in the middle? $12.5K?"
- **You:** "I can do $13K if you prepay 6 months. That's my absolute limit."

**Why It Works:** Feels collaborative. They "won" the negotiation.

---

### Red Flags (Walk Away Scenarios)

**Walk away if:**
1. They want to change the 60/30/10 split (Gospel violation)
2. They want month-to-month contracts (too much churn risk)
3. They demand Net 90+ payment terms without compensation (cash flow killer)
4. They refuse to involve decision-makers (you're wasting time with influencers)
5. They ask for free pilots with no commitment (tire kickers)
6. They want to support non-pediatric charities (mission misalignment)
7. They exhibit unethical behavior (e.g., asking you to lie to their board)

**How to Walk Away Professionally:**

> "I don't think we're the right fit for your needs. Here's why: [specific reason]. I'd be happy to refer you to [competitor] who might be better aligned. Thanks for your time."

**Why It Works:** Preserves relationship, protects your reputation, saves time.

---

### Closing the Deal

**Final Push Script:**

> "So here's where we are:
> - You need [pain point solved]
> - We've agreed on [tier + pricing + terms]
> - You've seen the demo and talked to references
>
> What's stopping us from moving forward today?"

**Listen for:**
- **"Nothing, let's do it."** → Send contract immediately.
- **"I need to check with [decision-maker]."** → Schedule follow-up call with them included.
- **"I'm still concerned about [objection]."** → Handle objection now. Don't leave it unresolved.

---

**Close Techniques:**

**1. Assumptive Close:**
> "Great! I'll send the contract over today. How do you prefer to sign - DocuSign or wet signature?"

**2. Urgency Close (Use Sparingly):**
> "If you sign by Friday, I can get you live before [relevant deadline]. After Friday, we're booked until [date]."

**3. Choice Close:**
> "Do you want to start with the Growth tier or jump straight to Enterprise?"

**4. Puppy Dog Close:**
> "Let's do a 3-month pilot. If you're not happy, you can walk away. If you love it (which I know you will), we convert to a 12-month contract."

---

## APPENDIX: SALES TEAM RESOURCES

### Quick Reference Card

**Discovery Questions (Top 5):**
1. What AI vendors are you currently using?
2. Do you have ESG/CSR goals?
3. What's frustrating about your current setup?
4. What would make your life easier in 6 months?
5. What's your timeline for decisions?

**Objection Handling (Top 3):**
1. "Too expensive" → ROI Calculator (consolidate AI + CSR budgets)
2. "We already have a vendor" → Multi-model flexibility (no vendor lock-in)
3. "How do we know 60% goes to charity?" → Quarterly impact reports (transparent)

**Closing Techniques (Top 3):**
1. Assumptive Close: "I'll send the contract today. DocuSign or wet signature?"
2. Pilot Close: "Let's do 3 months. If you're not happy, walk away."
3. Choice Close: "Growth tier or Enterprise?"
