## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

**1. Overusing Premium Services**
- You don't need Wire Plus for every announcement
- Save premium features for major milestones
- Use Professional tier as default

- FOR THE KIDS is unique because of charitable component
- EIN Presswire should ALWAYS be included

**4. Poor Timing**
- Don't distribute Friday afternoon (gets lost in weekend shuffle)

- Tuesday-Thursday 9 AM EST is optimal

**5. Generic Messaging**
- Customize each press release for service type

- Lead with charity angle for nonprofit services
- Lead with business metrics for enterprise services
