### AI Platform Commits 60% of All Revenue to Verified Pediatric Charities Through Blockchain-Enforced Transparency

**Tech Founder Builds First-of-Its-Kind System Where Majority of Profits Flow Directly to Children's Hospitals - No Trust Required**

**GAINESVILLE, FL - December 17, 2025** - TRASH OR TREASURE ONLINE RECYCLER LLC today announced the official launch of FOR THE KIDS, an artificial intelligence platform that allocates 60 percent of all revenue directly to verified pediatric charities through backend-enforced profit allocation, with smart contract deployment planned for Q1 2026.

The platform operates under "Gospel V1.3," an immutable revenue split that directs the majority of profits to children's hospitals before operational costs or founder compensation. Unlike traditional corporate giving programs that donate a small percentage after profitability, FOR THE KIDS makes charitable allocation mathematically inseparable from its business model.

"Most companies promise to give back someday when they're profitable," said Joshua Coleman, founder and CEO. "We're inverting that model. The children get their 60 percent first, automatically, through backend allocation. This isn't marketing - it's embedded in our architecture."

The platform currently partners with verified pediatric charities and plans to deploy smart contracts on Base blockchain in Q1 2026, enabling real-time public verification of every transaction. The allocation split is hardcoded: 60 percent to verified pediatric charities, 30 percent to infrastructure and operations, and 10 percent to the founder.

### Blockchain Transparency Eliminates Trust Requirements

Traditional charity platforms rely on annual reports and third-party auditors to verify donations. FOR THE KIDS uses blockchain technology to provide real-time proof of allocation, making every transaction publicly auditable.

"We don't ask people to trust us," Coleman explained. "The code is open-source. The planned smart contracts will be publicly verifiable. Anyone can confirm that 60 percent actually flows to children's hospitals. That level of accountability didn't exist before blockchain."

### AI-Powered Operations Ensure Mission Integrity

The platform is managed by a collaboration of four leading AI systems - Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google), Perplexity, and Grok (xAI) - which enforce the 60/30/10 split through automated checks and audits.

"The AI systems don't sleep, don't make accounting errors, and can't be pressured to change the allocation," Coleman said. "They monitor every transaction and shut down the platform if anyone attempts to alter the 60 percent commitment."

### From Personal Hardship to Platform Purpose

Coleman's commitment stems from personal experience. Having faced financial hardship in his youth and benefited from community support, he built FOR THE KIDS on a principle of obligation to those still struggling.

"People helped me when I had nothing. This platform will outlive me - the backend allocation system will keep directing funds to pediatric charities long after I'm gone," Coleman said. "That's the legacy worth building."

### Platform Services and Revenue Model

FOR THE KIDS generates revenue through AI-powered services including business automation, content creation, data analysis, and workflow optimization. Every customer payment triggers the automatic 60/30/10 allocation through backend logic, with smart contract enforcement planned for Q1 2026.

The platform is currently operational at aidoesitall.website with verified backend allocation active. Smart contract deployment to Base blockchain will add public transaction verification and on-chain proof of allocation.

### About TRASH OR TREASURE ONLINE RECYCLER LLC

TRASH OR TREASURE ONLINE RECYCLER LLC (EIN: 33-4655313) is a Florida-based technology company founded by Joshua Coleman. The company operates the FOR THE KIDS platform with the mission to allocate the majority of profits to verified pediatric charities through transparent backend allocation.

# DOCUMENT 2: SHORT VERSION FOR SOCIAL (150 WORDS)

**AI Platform Gives 60% of Revenue to Children's Hospitals - Enforced by Blockchain**

Florida tech founder Joshua Coleman launched FOR THE KIDS, an AI platform that automatically allocates 60 percent of all revenue to verified pediatric charities through backend-enforced profit allocation.

Unlike traditional corporate giving programs, FOR THE KIDS doesn't wait for profitability to give back. The 60/30/10 split is hardcoded into the platform's architecture, monitored by AI systems, and will be enforced by smart contracts deployed to Base blockchain in Q1 2026.

"We're proving you can build a sustainable business that gives the majority of profits away," Coleman said. "Not 2 percent, not 10 percent - sixty percent. And blockchain technology proves it's actually happening."

The platform is live at aidoesitall.website with verified backend allocation active.

# DOCUMENT 3: QUOTE SHEET (5 FOUNDER QUOTES)

## JOSHUA COLEMAN - FOUNDER & CEO
**Available for interviews via phone, video, or in-person**

### Quote 1: On the Business Model
"Most companies promise to give back someday when they're profitable. We're inverting that model. The children get their 60 percent first, automatically, through backend allocation with planned smart contract enforcement. This isn't marketing - it's embedded in our core architecture."

### Quote 2: On Transparency
"We don't ask people to trust us. The code is open-source. The planned smart contracts will be publicly verifiable on Base blockchain. Anyone can confirm that 60 percent actually flows to children's hospitals. That level of accountability didn't exist before blockchain technology."

### Quote 3: On AI-Powered Enforcement
"The AI systems don't sleep, don't make accounting errors, and can't be pressured to change the allocation. They monitor every transaction through backend logic and will shut down the platform if anyone attempts to alter the 60 percent commitment. This is governance by code, not by promises."

### Quote 4: On Personal Motivation
"People helped me when I had nothing. I faced serious hardship in my youth, and without community support, I wouldn't be here today. This platform is my way of paying that forward at scale. The backend allocation system will keep directing funds to pediatric charities long after I'm gone. That's the legacy worth building."

### Quote 5: On Industry Impact
"We're proving you can build a sustainable business that gives the majority of its profits away. Not 2 percent, not 10 percent - sixty percent. And we're using blockchain technology to prove it's actually happening in real-time. This is the future of corporate social responsibility: provable, transparent, and mathematically enforced."

## TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES

### Issue: Wire service rejects submission for "donation" language
**Solution:** This release is already compliant. Uses "allocation" and "profit sharing," never "donation" or "escrow."

### Issue: Wire service asks for charity verification
**Solution:** Provide partner EIN (pending). Explain backend allocation system with planned smart contract enforcement.

### Issue: Wire service flags blockchain claims
**Solution:** Clarify that smart contract deployment is planned Q1 2026. Current system uses backend allocation with verified logic.

### Issue: Traffic overwhelms website
**Solution:** Cloudflare should handle surge. If needed, enable "I'm Under Attack" mode temporarily.

### Issue: Too many journalist inquiries to respond to
**Solution:** Prioritize Tier 1 publications (TechCrunch, Forbes, Bloomberg). Send standard response to others with press kit link.

### Issue: Negative coverage or skepticism
**Solution:** Point to open-source code, backend allocation logs, and planned blockchain verification. Offer technical walkthrough.
