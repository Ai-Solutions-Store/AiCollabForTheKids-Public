## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: How long does a hospital partnership take to close?**
A: 30-90 days from initial contact to signed agreement, depending on hospital size and decision-making process. Larger hospitals may take longer.

**Q: What's the minimum revenue threshold to activate a partnership?**
A: None. Every hospital is valuable. Even if you generate small revenue initially, the relationship is ongoing and scales over time.

**Q: Can we customize the 60/30/10 split for specific hospitals?**
A: No. This is immutable per Gospel V1.3. The 60% allocation to hospitals is non-negotiable. This is a core principle, not a negotiation point.

**Q: How do we handle hospitals that want equity or special terms?**
A: We redirect to the core model. Explain that our structure is intentional - it ensures hospitals always benefit from our success, regardless of our growth trajectory.

**Q: What if a hospital wants more than 60%?**
A: Acknowledge their ask, but maintain the integrity of the Gospel V1.3 model. You can offer other benefits (consulting role, advisory board seat) but not a different revenue split.

**Q: How do we onboard healthcare workers into MedHeroes?**
A: Hospitals announce the program internally. Healthcare workers verify credentials on our platform. Discounts activate immediately. Hospital staff can support onboarding process.

**Q: What's the timeline for first revenue to reach hospitals?**
A: Ideally 30-60 days after partnership agreement, once platform launches and gets first transactions.
