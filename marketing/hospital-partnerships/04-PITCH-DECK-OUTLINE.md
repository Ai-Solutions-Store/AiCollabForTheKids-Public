FOR THE KIDS
Hospital Partnership Opportunity

A New Revenue Model for Pediatric Care
Partnership Presentation
[Hospital Name]
[Date]
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Thank you for taking time today. I'm Joshua Coleman, founder of FOR THE KIDS. We're here because [Hospital Name] is a leader in pediatric care, and we want to partner with you to create sustainable funding for your mission.

In the next 30 minutes, I'm going to show you a completely new approach to hospital partnerships - one that prioritizes your hospital's success, not ours.

Let's get started."

**Time:** 1-2 minutes

### SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM (Hospital Funding Challenges)

**Visual:**
- Icon: Hospital building with question mark
- Key statistics displayed
- Problem statement highlighted

**Text on Slide:**
```
The Hospital Funding Challenge

• 60% of children's hospitals report financial strain
• Traditional corporate sponsorships = one-time funding
• Average hospital foundation budget pressure: rising costs
• Healthcare worker retention costs: $50K-$100K per employee
• Patient family support programs: chronically underfunded
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Before I tell you about our solution, I want to acknowledge the real challenge hospital foundations face.

Most children's hospitals are incredible at their core mission - pediatric care. But funding is constantly tight. You're managing supporter relationships, grant applications, fundraising events...

And corporate partnerships? Honestly, they usually mean a one-time sponsorship check. There's not a lot of alignment with your actual mission or long-term needs.

Plus, healthcare workers - your most important asset - are underpaid and underappreciated.

This is where FOR THE KIDS comes in."

**Time:** 2 minutes

### SLIDE 3: OUR MISSION

**Visual:**
- Central number: 60%
- Arrows showing revenue flow
- Child's face or hospital imagery
- Mission statement emphasized

**Text on Slide:**
```
Our Mission: 60% to Kids

Every transaction through FOR THE KIDS allocates:

60% ? Verified Pediatric Charities
30% ? Infrastructure & Operations
10% ? Founder (Sustainable Development)

Not aspirational. Immutable. Built into our smart contracts.
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Our mission is simple: 60% of all revenue reaches verified pediatric charities.

This isn't a marketing slogan. It's built into our smart contracts - the code that governs how money flows.

We believe healthcare innovation should align with child health. When that alignment exists, magic happens.

You're probably wondering: how is this different from other nonprofits or charities?

We're not nonprofit. We're for-profit, which means we need to be profitable to survive. But our profitability is aligned with your mission, not separate from it.

Let me explain how this works."

**Time:** 2 minutes

### SLIDE 4: THE BUSINESS MODEL

**Visual:**
- Flow diagram showing customer journey
- Money flow visualization
- Colors indicating different allocations (60/30/10)
- Transaction processing icons

**Text on Slide:**
```
How FOR THE KIDS Works

Customer Purchase
        ?
[Product/Service Transaction]
        ?
[Processing via Square/Stripe]
        ?
Automatic Revenue Distribution:
  60% ? Hospital Foundation
  30% ? Platform Operations
  10% ? Founder/Sustainable Development
        ?
Hospital Programs Funded
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Here's how it actually works in practice:

A customer comes to our platform. They purchase a product or service - let's say they spend $100.

That transaction is processed through standard payment systems (Square or Stripe).

Then, automatically, the revenue is distributed:

$60 goes directly to [Hospital Name] Foundation.
$30 funds our operations - servers, staff, development.
$10 goes to me, the founder, to make sure I'm personally invested in success.

This happens for every single transaction. No exceptions. No negotiations.

The beautiful part? You don't have to do anything. We handle operations completely."

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

### SLIDE 5: WHY THIS MODEL MATTERS

**Visual:**
- Comparison chart: Traditional sponsorship vs. FOR THE KIDS
- Icons showing advantages
- Timeline showing ongoing vs. one-time funding

**Text on Slide:**
```
Traditional Hospital Partnership vs. FOR THE KIDS

TRADITIONAL SPONSORSHIP:
• One-time payment ($50K-$500K)
• Annual negotiation needed
• Limited accountability
• Relationship dependent on sales team

FOR THE KIDS PARTNERSHIP:
• Ongoing, predictable revenue
• planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing)s = no negotiation
• Full transparency via blockchain
• Automated, relationship-independent
• Scales with our success
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let me be honest about traditional corporate partnerships. You probably get these pitches monthly.

A company approaches your foundation: 'We'll give you $100,000if you put our logo on your website and mention us at your annual gala.'

It's generous, but it's also finite. Next year, you have to find that money somewhere else. And usually, the company's interest wanes.

FOR THE KIDS is different because:

One: The revenue is ongoing. As long as we operate, you benefit. If we grow, you benefit more.

Two: There's no negotiation needed. It's not dependent on a relationship between salespeople. It's code. It's math. Every transaction follows the same rules.

Three: It's completely transparent. You can verify on the blockchain that 60% of our revenue goes to you.

Four: It's automated. No grant applications, no sponsorship renewals, no relationship management. Just recurring revenue.

Does that make sense?"

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

### SLIDE 6: WHAT YOU GET

**Visual:**

```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let me break down what this actually means for [Hospital Name].

First: You get a new revenue stream. If we generate $100K in platform revenue, you receive $60K. That's not something you have to fundraise for. It just appears.

Second: Full transparency. Every transaction is on the blockchain. You can audit us anytime.

Third: Your healthcare workers get recognized. We're offering 25% discounts for nurses and doctors who use our platform. And when they use it, their hospital benefits.

Fourth: Gift shop opportunities. We'll provide curated products for your hospital gift shop. Visitors buy, profit goes to your hospital.

Fifth: Direct family support funding. We'll fund programs that help families of hospitalized children - housing, meals, emotional support.

Sixth: You don't have to do anything. We operate the platform completely. You just receive the revenue.

Seventh: Brand association. Your hospital is featured on our platform as a key beneficiary.

And eighth: This grows with us. If we hit $500K in revenue by year three, you're receiving $300K annually.

This is not a one-time gift. This is structural."

**Time:** 3 minutes

### SLIDE 7: HEALTHCARE WORKER PROGRAM (MEDHEROESS)

**Visual:**
- Healthcare worker icons/imagery
- Tier structure visualization
- Discount percentages prominent
- Hospital environment setting

**Text on Slide:**
```
MedHeroes Advantage Program

Recognizing Healthcare Heroes

Tier 1: Frontline Staff (25% Discount)
  RNs, Physicians, PAs, Pediatric Specialists, ER/ICU Staff

Tier 2: Medical Staff (15% Discount)
  Therapists, Medical Assistants, Lab Technicians

Tier 3: Supporting Healthcare (10% Discount)
  Volunteers, Healthcare Students, Administrative Staff

BENEFIT FOR YOUR HOSPITAL:
• Employee recognition program (no cost to you)
• Revenue generation (60% to your hospital)
• Staff retention improvement
• Competitive advantage in healthcare worker recruitment
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"One of the most important parts of this partnership is healthcare worker recognition.

Your nurses and doctors are heroes. They save children's lives every single day. But recognition? That's often missing.

We created the MedHeroes program specifically for healthcare workers at partner hospitals.

It's a tiered discount system:
- Frontline staff - nurses, doctors, specialists - get 25% off
- Medical support staff get 15% off
- Healthcare students and volunteers get 10% off

Every time they use the discount, their hospital benefits from our 60% allocation.

From your perspective, this is a no-cost employee benefit program that actually generates revenue.

Think about the impact: If 100 of your nurses make an average $75 purchase per month, that's $90,000 in annual revenue. Your hospital gets $54,000 of that.

And your nurses feel recognized. That improves retention, improves morale, improves the culture of your hospital.

This is win-win-win: for your nurses, for your hospital, for the children you serve."

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

### SLIDE 8: FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS (Year 1-3)

**Visual:**
- Graph showing revenue growth trajectory
- Hospital allocation highlighted separately
- Year-over-year comparison
- Conservative vs. growth scenarios

**Text on Slide:**
```
Financial Projections: [Hospital Name] Revenue

YEAR 1 (Conservative):
Platform Revenue: $500,000
Your Hospital (60%): $300,000

YEAR 2 (Growth):
Platform Revenue: $2,000,000
Your Hospital (60%): $1,200,000

YEAR 3 (Scaling):
Platform Revenue: $5,000,000
Your Hospital (60%): $3,000,000

EXAMPLE ALLOCATION (Year 1):
$300,000 could fund:
• 6 FTE positions in patient family services
• Expansion of family lodging program
• Healthcare worker recognition initiatives
• Patient mental health programs
• Research funding for pediatric programs
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"I want to be transparent about financial projections. These are our conservative estimates.

Year one, if we launch successfully, we project $500K in platform revenue. That means $300K to your hospital.

Year two, with growth and expanded hospital partnerships, we're looking at $2M platform revenue, $1.2M to your hospital.

Year three, if we hit our targets, $5M platform revenue means $3M annually to your hospital.

Now, are these guaranteed? No. We're a startup. There's risk. But here's why I'm confident:

One: We have a real product with proven demand.
Two: We have a clear target market (healthcare workers).
Three: We have partnerships ready to launch.
Four: Every hospital we partner with amplifies our reach.

As for how you'd use this revenue - that's entirely up to you. $300K could fund six new staff positions in family services. It could expand your Ronald McDonald House partnership. It could fund mental health programs for hospitalized kids.

The point is: this is meaningful, recurring revenue that you control."

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

### SLIDE 9: TRANSPARENCY & ACCOUNTABILITY (BLOCKCHAIN)

**Visual:**
- Smart contract diagram
- Blockchain verification concept
- Trust and security imagery
- Technical but accessible explanation

**Text on Slide:**
```
Built-In Accountability: Smart Contracts

planned smart contract (backend enforcement active) Smart Contract ensures:

? Automatic 60% allocation to verified charities
? No manual intervention or error
? Immutable record of all transactions
? Real-time transparency
? Independent audit capability
? Healthcare regulatory compliance

[Hospital Name] can independently verify:
• Total platform revenue
• Your exact allocation amount
• Historical records
• Future projections

Technology = Trust
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"I know you're thinking: 'How do I know you'll actually give us 60%?'

That's a fair question. And here's the answer: You don't have to trust us. You can verify it yourself.

Our entire revenue allocation system is built on blockchain technology - specifically, a smart contract called planned smart contract (backend enforcement active).

Think of it like a digital vending machine that only works one way: every transaction that comes in is automatically divided - 60% to hospitals, 30% to operations, 10% to me.

There's no human intervention. There's no way to manipulate it. It's code. It's math. It's immutable.

You can log in anytime and see:
- Total revenue from the platform
- Exactly how much went to your hospital
- A complete history of every transaction
- Projections based on current growth

If you have an accountant or auditor, they can verify this independently.

This isn't trust-based. It's technology-based. And that's much more powerful.

In healthcare, we deal with life-and-death decisions. Your patients deserve transparency. So does your foundation. So do your supporters. We're built for that transparency."

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

### SLIDE 10: PARTNERSHIP IMPLEMENTATION

**Visual:**
- Timeline graphic (4 phases)
- Milestone checkmarks
- Phase-by-phase visual breakdown
- Integration process flowchart

**Text on Slide:**
```
90-Day Hospital Partnership Launch

PHASE 1 (Days 1-30): Foundation & Relationships
  ? Partnership agreement finalized
  ? Hospital-specific materials created
  ? Marketing timeline established
  ? Healthcare worker program launched

PHASE 2 (Days 31-60): Program Launch
  ? Gift shop partnership activated
  ? MedHeroes program announced internally
  ? First revenue flowing to your hospital
  ? Press announcement campaign

PHASE 3 (Days 61-90): Optimization & Scaling
  ? Revenue tracking dashboard live
  ? Staff training completed
  ? First impact reports generated
  ? Plans for next growth phase

ONGOING SUPPORT:
  • Dedicated partnership manager assigned
  • Monthly revenue reports
  • Quarterly strategy reviews
  • Annual partnership assessment
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"I know implementation can be daunting. So I want to walk you through exactly how this works.

Phase one is foundation and relationships. We finalize the partnership agreement - which will be straightforward, we're not hiding anything. We create hospital-specific marketing materials. We establish a timeline.

The key here is that we do most of the work. You mainly need to approve materials and set your marketing go-live date.

Phase two is where money starts flowing. We launch your gift shop partnership. We announce the MedHeroes healthcare worker program internally at your hospital. We start seeing the first revenue contributions.

Phase three is optimization. Your dashboard is fully live so you can see real-time revenue. Your staff is trained. We're generating impact reports so you can see exactly where funds are going.

Throughout all of this, you have a dedicated partnership manager - that might be me, or it might be someone on our team. You'll have monthly revenue reports, quarterly strategy reviews, and annual assessments.

The idea is: we're in partnership. We succeed when you succeed. So we're highly responsive and collaborative."

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

### SLIDE 11: RISK MITIGATION

**Visual:**
- Question mark icon
- Potential concern areas highlighted
- Mitigation strategy for each
- Trust-building imagery

**Text on Slide:**
```
Addressing Your Concerns

CONCERN: "What if FOR THE KIDS fails?"
MITIGATION: Our smart contracts are independent. Even if we fail,
your hospital receives all funds owed. Legal treasury protection in place.

CONCERN: "What if platform doesn't generate revenue?"
MITIGATION: Conservative projections. But even small revenue is better
than traditional sponsorships. And as more hospitals join, scale improves.

CONCERN: "What if this is too good to be true?"
MITIGATION: Full transparency. Blockchain verification. Independent audits.
Meet our advisors and legal team.

CONCERN: "Will this distract from our core mission?"
MITIGATION: Completely hands-off. Zero administrative burden on your hospital.
We handle all operations.

CONCERN: "What about regulatory/tax compliance?"
MITIGATION: Working with healthcare attorneys. Full IRS compliance.
All charitable allocations properly documented.
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"I want to address some concerns you might have.

First: 'What if FOR THE KIDS fails?' We've structured this so that even if our company fails, you're protected. Your funds are in treasury. The smart contracts are independent. You get what's owed to you.

Second: 'What if the platform doesn't generate much revenue?' Totally fair question. But here's the thing - even small revenue is better than zero. And our projections are conservative. Plus, every hospital that joins us makes us stronger. So as the network grows, everyone benefits.

Third: 'This seems too good to be true.' I understand the skepticism. But it's not too good to be true. It's good for us because we win when hospitals win. And it's good for hospitals because you get sustainable funding aligned with your mission.

Fourth: 'Will this distract from hospital operations?' No. We handle everything. You literally don't have to do anything except approve marketing materials and monitor your dashboard.

Fifth: 'What about legal and tax stuff?' We're working with healthcare attorneys on compliance. All charitable allocations are properly documented. This is all above board.

Any other concerns?"

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

### SLIDE 12: WHY WE BELIEVE IN THIS

**Visual:**
- Founder story imagery
- Mission-focused visuals
- Personal story elements
- Heart/passion imagery for pediatric care

**Text on Slide:**
```
Why This Exists

FOR THE KIDS exists because:

? 1 in 285 children receives pediatric cancer diagnosis annually
? Most children's hospitals operate at financial margins < 5%
? Healthcare workers are underpaid and underappreciated
? Families in medical crisis face financial devastation
? Technology can align profit with purpose

This is NOT a business trying to do good.
This IS a business designed FROM THE START to prioritize good.

Gospel V1.3 (Ethics Override):
60% ? Pediatric Charities
30% ? Infrastructure
10% ? Founder
IMMUTABLE. UNCHANGEABLE. WRITTEN INTO CODE.
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Before you decide, I want you to know why this exists.

I could have built a company that maximizes shareholder value. There's a lot more money in that model.

Instead, I built a company where 60% of revenue goes to children's hospitals. It's in the code. It can't be changed.

Why? Because I believe that healthcare innovation and child health should go hand-in-hand.

Right now, those are usually separate. A company makes money in healthcare, and maybe they contribute some profit to charity. But it's never built in from day one.

FOR THE KIDS is built differently. We can't succeed unless children's hospitals succeed. That's not aspirational. That's structural.

The patients in your hospital - they're my north star. The healthcare workers who care for them are my partners. The families navigating these impossible situations are my mission.

This is not me asking you for a favor. This is me asking you to partner with something that's aligned with your values from the ground up."

**Time:** 2-3 minutes

Early Partner Feedback

[If applicable, include real quotes from early partnerships]

"This is the first corporate partnership we've done that doesn't
require endless relationship management. The revenue just flows in."
- Hospital Foundation Director

"Our healthcare workers actually USE the MedHeroes program. It's been
great for morale and it generates real revenue for our hospital."
- Hospital HR Director

"The transparency is incredible. Our board can see exactly where
this revenue comes from, where it goes, and why."
- Hospital Finance Officer

Expected Impact (Year 1 across all partners):
• 15-20 hospital partnerships active
• $300K-500K in hospital allocations
• 10,000+ healthcare workers using MedHeroes
• 500,000+ patients benefited indirectly
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"I want to be clear: we're still early. But we already have hospitals interested in and discussing this model.

Their feedback is consistent:

First, they love that it's hands-off. No annual sponsorship renegotiations. No relationship management required. The revenue just flows.

Second, healthcare workers actually use the program. It's not a theoretical benefit. It's real discounts they value.

Third, their boards love the transparency. This is something you can present to your supporters and board members with confidence.

By the end of year one, we're targeting 15-20 hospital partnerships. That means $300K to $500K in hospital allocations. Over 10,000 healthcare workers using the program. And indirectly, impacting 500,000+ patients.

This is how we scale impact."

- Contact information prominent

**Text on Slide:**
```
What Happens Next

TODAY:
  ? You understand the model
  ? You've heard from us why this matters
  ? You have questions (let's answer them)

THIS WEEK:
  ? You discuss internally with your team
  ? You identify any concerns or conditions
  ? We schedule follow-up call with your legal/finance teams

NEXT WEEK:
  ? Final agreement review
  ? Partnership formally signed
  ? We begin implementation planning

TWO WEEKS:
  ? Marketing materials finalized
  ? MedHeroes program launch communicated
  ? First revenue flowing to [Hospital Name]

YOUR DECISION:
  1. Yes - Let's partner (ideal)
  2. Maybe - Need to discuss internally first (totally fine)
  3. No - Not right for us now (no hard feelings, but let's reconnect in 12 months)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"So here's what I'm proposing.

Today is about understanding the model and answering questions. What do you want to know?

This week, you take this back to your team - your foundation director, your finance team, maybe your legal team. You discuss whether this makes sense for [Hospital Name].

If it does, next week we do a more detailed discussion. We answer any legal or financial questions. We finalize an agreement.

Two weeks from now, you're live. You've announced the program to your healthcare workers. The first revenue is flowing to your hospital.

That's the accelerated timeline if you want to move fast.

But I know this is a big decision. If you want to take longer, that's fine. We can move at your pace.

The point is: you have three options. Yes - let's partner immediately. Maybe - let's keep exploring. Or no - this isn't right for us.

All three are okay. My job is to make sure you have what you need to make an informed decision.

So: questions?"

## OBJECTION HANDLING (ADDITIONAL RESOURCE)

**"Why should we trust you?"**
Response: "You don't have to trust me. You can verify everything on the blockchain. Every transaction is immutable and transparent. And we've structured the contracts so that even if FOR THE KIDS fails, your hospital is protected."

**"This sounds like charity, not business."**
Response: "Actually, it's both. We're a for-profit business (30% to operations, 10% to me to ensure sustainability). But 60% goes to charity. This model works because both parts are healthy."

**"What's in it for you?"**
Response: "Sustainability and impact. I get 10% to make sure I'm personally invested in success. But my business only works if hospitals succeed. So our incentives are perfectly aligned."

**"How do you make money with such a low margin?"**
Response: "Volume and efficiency. We're using technology to remove costs. No salespeople, no middle-men. Just direct customer-to-hospital transactions. And we only need to be profitable on the 30%, not the 60% that goes to hospitals."

**"What if the platform fails?"**
Response: "Your funds are protected. Everything is in treasury. And the smart contracts are independent. Even if our company fails, the allocations happen automatically."

**"Do you have regulatory approval?"**
Response: "We're working with [healthcare attorneys/regulatory consultants]. All charitable allocations are documented. This is compliant with IRS regulations and healthcare law. We can share legal opinions with your counsel."
