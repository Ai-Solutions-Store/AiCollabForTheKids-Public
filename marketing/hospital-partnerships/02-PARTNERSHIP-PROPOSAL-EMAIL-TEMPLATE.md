## PERSONALIZED OUTREACH EMAIL (Template 3: Research-Customized)

**Subject Line:**
```
Partnership Proposal: Sustainable Funding for [Hospital] Pediatric Research
```

**Email Body:**

```
Dear [VP of Development / Foundation Director],

I've been following [Hospital Name]'s groundbreaking work in [SPECIFIC RESEARCH AREA] and was impressed by [SPECIFIC INITIATIVE/AWARD/ANNOUNCEMENT].

I'm reaching out because FOR THE KIDS can directly support research programs like yours through a unique partnership model.

THE OPPORTUNITY FOR YOUR RESEARCH PROGRAMS

FOR THE KIDS allocates 60% of platform revenue to verified pediatric charities. This creates a sustainable, predictable funding stream specifically for research initiatives - something most corporate partnerships can't offer.

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR YOUR RESEARCH:
• Predictable, ongoing revenue (not one-time sponsorship)
• Funds flow directly to your research programs
• No reporting requirements or restrictions
• Blockchain-verified transparency
• Aligns with healthcare innovation values

EXAMPLE FINANCIAL IMPACT:
If we generate $100,000 in Year 1:
→ $60,000 goes directly to [Hospital Name] Foundation
→ Supports research initiatives, family programs, healthcare worker recognition

If platform scales to $500,000 by Year 3:
→ $300,000 annually to your pediatric research programs
→ Transforms funding sustainability

THE PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURE

This isn't a traditional sponsorship. It's structural: 60% of all transaction revenue, tracked transparently via smart contract, flows to your hospital.

NEXT CONVERSATION

I'd love to talk with your research leadership about specific initiatives that could benefit from sustained funding. A 30-minute call would help me understand your priorities and show you how this partnership could work.

Are you available for a call this Thursday or Friday?

Looking forward to supporting [Hospital Name]'s research mission.

Best regards,

Joshua Coleman
