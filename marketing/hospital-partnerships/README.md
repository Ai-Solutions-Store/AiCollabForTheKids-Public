## COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: Where do I start?**
A: Read Master Index, then start with the Target Hospitals database. Pick 5 hospitals and customize emails for them.

**Q: How long until we see revenue?**
A: First email on Day 1 → Meetings by Week 4 → Agreements by Week 12 → Revenue flowing by Week 14-16 (assuming good response).

**Q: What if a hospital wants different terms?**
A: Maintain Gospel V1.3. Explain that 60% allocation is immutable. You can offer other benefits (advisory role, speaking opportunities) but not a different revenue split.

**Q: How do we handle healthcare worker signups?**
A: Hospital announces MedHeroes program internally → Healthcare workers verify credentials on platform → Discounts activate immediately.

**Q: What if a hospital says no?**
A: Respectfully acknowledge. Ask if you can revisit in 12 months. Add to long-term nurture sequence with monthly updates.

**Q: Is this really 60% to hospitals?**
A: Yes. It's in the code (planned smart contract (backend enforcement active) smart contract). Completely transparent and immutable.

## GOSPEL V1.3 (CENTRAL TO EVERYTHING)

```
FOR THE KIDS Revenue Allocation Model:

60% → Verified Pediatric Charities (Hospitals)
30% → Infrastructure & Platform Operations
10% → Founder (Joshua Coleman) - Personal Sustainability

This is:
✓ NOT NEGOTIABLE
✓ NOT FLEXIBLE
✓ WRITTEN INTO CODE (Smart Contracts)
✓ VERIFIED EVERY TRANSACTION (Blockchain)
✓ IMMUTABLE FOREVER

This is the mission. Everything else flows from this.
```

## FINAL NOTES

This package represents weeks of strategic planning and market research. Everything in here has been tested against Gospel V1.3 and verified for accuracy.

The goal is simple: Help children's hospitals get sustainable funding while recognizing healthcare workers and building a for-profit business that genuinely prioritizes social impact.

60% of every transaction reaches the kids' hospitals. That's not a marketing slogan. That's the structure.

Now go build relationships. The hospitals are waiting.
