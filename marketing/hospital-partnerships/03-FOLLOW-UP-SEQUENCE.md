## DAY 1: INITIAL EMAIL OUTREACH

**Timing:** 9:30 AM on Tuesday-Thursday

**Email Subject:**
```
Strategic Partnership Opportunity: 60% Revenue Allocation to [Hospital Name]
```

**Email Template:**

```
Dear [First Name],

I'm reaching out with an extraordinary partnership opportunity that aligns
perfectly with [Hospital Name]'s mission of providing world-class pediatric care.

THE OPPORTUNITY

FOR THE KIDS is a healthcare-tech platform that allocates 60% of all revenue
directly to verified pediatric charities. We're looking for leading children's
hospitals like yours to be at the center of this mission.

YOUR HOSPITAL BENEFITS:

1. Direct Revenue Share: 60% of every transaction flows to your hospital
2. Transparent Tracking: All funds tracked on blockchain (planned smart contract (backend enforcement active))
3. No Administrative Burden: We handle all operations
4. Employee Recognition: Healthcare worker discount program (25% for frontline staff)
5. Patient/Family Support: Direct funding for existing programs

THE REVENUE SPLIT:

Customer Purchase → 60% to Your Hospital Foundation
                 → 30% to Platform Operations
                 → 10% to Founder (Sustainable Development)

NEXT STEPS

I'd love to schedule a 30-minute call with your Corporate Partnerships team
to discuss integration details.

Are you available for a brief introduction call this week?

Best regards,

Joshua Coleman

## DAY 5: FIRST FOLLOW-UP EMAIL

**Timing:** 10 AM on Monday (different day than initial)

**Subject Line:**
```
FOR THE KIDS Partnership - Quick Follow-up [Hospital Name]
```

**Email Template:**

```
Hi [First Name],

Just wanted to check in on the partnership proposal I sent earlier this week.

I realize you're busy - hospital fundraising teams receive dozens of partnership
pitches every month. But this one is different.

THE UNIQUE PART:

Most corporate partnerships give you a one-time sponsorship.

FOR THE KIDS gives you ongoing, predictable revenue:
- 60% of every transaction for as long as we operate
- Transparent blockchain tracking
- Zero administrative burden
- Aligns with your hospital's values

FINANCIAL EXAMPLE:
- If we hit $100K in Year 1 revenue → $60K to your hospital
- If we scale to $500K by Year 3 → $300K annually to your hospital
- That's not sponsorship. That's structural partnership.

QUICK QUESTION:

Would 30 minutes on your calendar this week make sense to explore this?
I can work around your schedule.

Best regards,

Joshua Coleman
Founder, FOR THE KIDS Campaign

P.S. If you're not the right person for this conversation, could you point
me toward whoever leads corporate partnerships at [Hospital Name]?

## DAY 8: PHONE CALL ATTEMPT #1

**Timing:** 10-11 AM (business hours, mid-morning)

**Call Script:**

```
[Dial main hospital number → ask for Corporate Partnerships office]

"Hi, this is Joshua Coleman with FOR THE KIDS. I emailed [Name] a few days ago
about a partnership opportunity with our platform. Is [he/she] available for a
brief call, or should I continue via email?"

[If available:]
"Thanks for picking up! I'll keep this quick - I know you're busy.

FOR THE KIDS is a healthcare platform allocating 60% of revenue directly to
pediatric hospitals. We're building partnerships with the top children's hospitals
in the country.

[Hospital Name] is on our priority list because of your [specific reason: research
programs / innovation focus / community impact].

The simple version: customers buy from us, 60% of their purchase goes to your
hospital foundation.

I know you get a lot of partnership pitches. This one is different because the
revenue is ongoing, not one-time.

Would you have 30 minutes this week to talk through how this could work for
[Hospital Name]?"

[If unavailable:]
"No problem - I know you're in a meeting. I'll keep trying to reach you via
email. Or if you'd prefer, I'm happy to work with someone else on your team
who handles corporate partnerships?"

[Regardless:]
"Either way, I really hope we can explore this together. Every kid in your
hospital deserves the best, and FOR THE KIDS helps fund that mission."

transaction revenue, no strings attached.

My number is 352-973-5909. I'd love to grab 30 minutes on your calendar
this week. Thanks."
```

## DAY 12: SECOND FOLLOW-UP EMAIL

**Timing:** 2 PM on Wednesday (afternoon, different from previous)

**Subject Line:**
```
One Idea: [Hospital Name] + FOR THE KIDS Healthcare Worker Program
```

**Email Template:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I know you haven't gotten back to me yet - no worries, I'll keep this short.

I sent you information about our hospital partnership program. But there's
another angle I thought you'd appreciate: healthcare workers.

THE MEDHEROESS PROGRAM

Your nurses and doctors deserve special recognition. We created a 25% discount
program specifically for frontline healthcare staff.

Why this matters to your hospital:
✓ Improves employee satisfaction (no cost to you)
✓ Recognition program that healthcare workers actually use
✓ Drives revenue that benefits your hospital (60% to your programs)
✓ Simple to communicate (one internal email announcement)

EXAMPLE SCENARIO:
If you announce the MedHeroes program to your 500 frontline staff members:
- 20% adoption rate (100 healthcare workers)
- Average purchase = $75/month per user
- 100 users × $75 × 12 months = $90,000 in annual revenue
- Your hospital receives: $54,000 (60%)

That's meaningful revenue for employee benefits or family support programs.

TWO WAYS TO MOVE FORWARD:

1. Schedule a call with your Corporate Partnerships team (as I proposed earlier)
2. Chat with your HR/Employee Benefits team about the healthcare worker program

Either way, I'd love to help.

Are you available for a 20-minute call this week? Or should I reach out to
your HR department directly?

Thanks,

Joshua Coleman

```
[Hospital Name] Partnership: 30-Second Version
```

**Email Template:**

Hi [First Name],

I know you've been getting my emails, and I appreciate you hearing me out.

Let me make this really simple: I have a platform that allocates 60% of
revenue to pediatric hospitals. That's it.

You decide if it's worth 30 minutes of your time.

[Hospital Name] could benefit from:
• Sustainable revenue stream (not one-time sponsorship)
• Healthcare worker recognition program
• Gift shop partnership opportunities
• Patient family support funding

If this resonates, I'm available whenever works for you this week.

If this isn't relevant for your hospital, I completely understand - just
let me know and I'll stop reaching out.

## DAY 27: FINAL FOLLOW-UP EMAIL (DECISION PROMPT)

**Timing:** 9 AM on final business day of week

**Subject Line:**
```
[Hospital Name] Partnership: Final Check-In
```

**Email Template:**

```
Hi [First Name],

This is my last email - I promise.

Over the past few weeks, I've reached out about FOR THE KIDS and our
hospital partnership program. I've shared the financial model, talked
about healthcare worker recognition, and even recorded a video.

At this point, I think you fall into one of three categories:

1. INTERESTED: You want to learn more and discuss how this works for
   [Hospital Name]. → Let's schedule a call this week.

2. POSSIBLY INTERESTED: You see potential but want more details or need
   to discuss internally first. → Tell me what questions I can answer.

3. NOT A GOOD FIT: FOR THE KIDS isn't right for [Hospital Name] right now,
   and you'd prefer I stop reaching out. → I completely understand.
   No judgment. Just let me know.

Which one is it?

I'm available for a 30-minute call anytime this week, or I can answer
specific questions via email.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
