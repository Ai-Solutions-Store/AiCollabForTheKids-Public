**Subject:** FOR THE KIDS + Make-A-Wish: Granting Wishes Through Revenue Sharing

Dear [Make-A-Wish Foundation Leadership],

FOR THE KIDS is proposing a partnership that could help Make-A-Wish grant significantly more wishes through an innovative revenue-sharing model.

**THE VISION**

Imagine if every purchase a customer made directly contributed to granting wishes for children fighting critical illnesses. That's what we're proposing.

**HOW IT WORKS**

```
Customer Purchase ($100)
         ?
FOR THE KIDS Processing
         ?
$60 ? Make-A-Wish (directly grant wishes)
$30 ? Platform Operations
$10 ? Founder Sustainability

CUSTOMER SEES: "Your purchase helped grant 1 child's wish"
MAKE-A-WISH GETS: Direct, predictable, scalable funding
CHILDREN GET: More wishes granted
```

**PARTNERSHIP BENEFITS**

**For Make-A-Wish:**
- New revenue stream to grant more wishes (60% of platform revenue)
- No fundraising effort required
- Scalable funding model as platform grows
- National awareness of Make-A-Wish mission
- Healthcare worker engagement network

**For Healthcare Workers:**
- Opportunity to directly participate in wish granting
- "Wish Doctor" ambassador program
- Recognition for supporting wishes
- MedHeroes discounts while supporting Make-A-Wish

**For Patients & Families:**
- Direct connection between healing and wish fulfillment
- Hope and joy during difficult medical journeys
- Tangible support from medical community
- Real-time impact visibility

**FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS**

**Year 1 (Conservative):**
- Platform Revenue: $500,000
- Make-A-Wish Share: $300,000
- Wishes Granted: ~300 (at $1,000 per wish average)

**Year 3 (Growth Scenario):**
- Platform Revenue: $5,000,000
- Make-A-Wish Share: $3,000,000
- Wishes Granted: ~3,000+ annually

**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-2):**
- Formal partnership agreement
- Technology integration planning
- National launch announcement
- Initial marketing campaign

**Phase 2 (Months 3-6):**
- Platform integration with Make-A-Wish systems
- Healthcare worker ambassador recruitment
- Wish tracking and celebration infrastructure
- Regional launch across Make-A-Wish chapters

**Phase 3 (Months 7-12):**
- Scale and optimization
- Media storytelling and awareness
- Healthcare network expansion
- Year 1 impact reporting

**WHY THIS MATTERS**

Make-A-Wish serves 20,000+ children annually. Imagine if we could help you serve 30,000 children in three years through this partnership. Imagine if every healthcare worker in America became a potential wish granter through their purchases on our platform.

This isn't traditional sponsorship. This is structural alignment between a healthcare platform and the most important mission in child health: hope.

**NEXT STEPS**

I'd like to schedule a meeting with your national leadership to discuss:
1. Financial terms and revenue sharing structure
2. Technology integration and wish tracking
3. Healthcare worker ambassador program
4. National launch timeline and strategy
5. Expected impact and scaling

This partnership could transform Make-A-Wish's financial sustainability while helping millions of healthcare workers feel directly connected to wish fulfillment.
