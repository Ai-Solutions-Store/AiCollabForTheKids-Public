Hey [Name],

As a parent of [X kids/age], your content about [parenting topic] always hits home.

I wanted to share something I think you'll genuinely care about: we built a platform where 60% of every dollar goes to children's hospitals. Not as a charity - as a business model.

We call it Gospel V1.3. It's basically "what if we built a business that CAN'T screw over kids, even if we wanted to?"

Hi [Name],

Your work covering [charity/cause] has been invaluable. I'm reaching out because we're approaching charitable giving differently.

- 10% ? Founder compensation

The difference: This isn't contribution-based. It's sustainable. People get value, kids get help, and it scales.

I think your audience would be fascinated by this approach.

## RED FLAGS TO AVOID

### ? NEVER Say These Things

**1. "I know you get a lot of DMs but..."**
- Why it's bad: Draws attention to the fact you're mass messaging
- Say instead: Jump straight into the message

**2. "This is a great opportunity for you..."**
- Why it's bad: Sounds like every spam message they get
- Say instead: Focus on THEIR audience's benefit, not theirs

**3. "We're looking for influencers..."**
- Why it's bad: Makes them feel like a commodity
- Say instead: "I think your community would love this" or "Your audience is perfect for this"

**4. "Can you post about us for free/for exposure?"**
- Why it's bad: Disrespectful of their work and time
- Say instead: Always offer compensation (money, revenue share, free access, etc.)

**5. "We'll pay you in product/services..."**
- Why it's bad: Unless they specifically want your product, this is not payment
- Say instead: Offer product PLUS payment or revenue share

**6. "Our platform is like [competitor] but better..."**
- Why it's bad: Sounds defensive and unoriginal
- Say instead: Focus on what makes you unique without mentioning competitors

**7. "You'd be stupid not to do this..."**
- Why it's bad: Insulting and aggressive
- Say instead: "I think this could be a great fit" - keep it collaborative

**8. "This will go viral..."**
- Why it's bad: You can't promise virality and they know it
- Say instead: Share realistic projections or past performance data

**9. "Just one quick post..."**
- Why it's bad: Minimizes the work they put into content
- Say instead: Be upfront about time/effort required

**10. "Everyone's doing it..."**
- Why it's bad: Implies they should follow the crowd (not be a leader)
- Say instead: "You'd be one of our founding partners" - make them feel special

**11. "Act fast - limited time offer!"**
- Why it's bad: Feels like a scam/pyramid scheme tactic
- Say instead: Be honest about timelines without pressure

**12. "Per my last message..."**
- Why it's bad: Passive-aggressive and annoying
- Say instead: "Wanted to bump this in case it got buried"

### ?? Behaviors That Kill Response Rates

**1. Generic Copy-Paste**
- They can tell. Always personalize at least the first 2 lines.

**2. Sending Long Paragraphs**
- People skim DMs. Keep it scannable.

**3. Being Overly Formal on Casual Platforms**
- Match the platform's vibe. Instagram ? LinkedIn.

**4. Asking for Too Much Too Soon**
- Start with interest, not a full partnership proposal.

**5. Ignoring Their Content Style**
- If they're super casual, don't send a corporate pitch.

**6. Following Up Too Soon**
- Wait at least 5 days before following up.

**7. Following Up Too Many Times**
- Max 3 follow-ups. Then move on.

**8. Using Their Full Name Repeatedly**
- "[Name], as I mentioned [Name], this is perfect for you [Name]" = creepy

**9. Sending Voice Messages Unsolicited**
- Some people love it, most find it invasive from strangers.

**10. Including Too Many Links**
- Looks like spam. Max 1 link in first message.

---

### ?? Research Red Flags (Don't Contact If...)

**1. They explicitly say "No DMs for collabs"**
- Respect their wishes. Find another way (email, management, etc.)

**2. They recently posted negatively about charity scams**
- You'll have to work 10x harder to build trust. Maybe skip.

**3. They're currently in a controversy**
- Bad timing. Wait until it blows over.

**4. Their last post was 6+ months ago**
- They're not active. Your message will likely go unseen.

**5. They're primarily sponsored content**
- They're expensive and may not be authentic about it.

**6. Their engagement rate is suspiciously low**
- Might have bought followers. Check engagement before reaching out.

**7. They've promoted similar charity platforms before**
- They might be fatigued. Approach differently or skip.

**8. Their audience is completely mismatched**
- Don't waste their time or yours.

What specific questions do you have? Happy to jump on a quick call if that's easier.

[Your Name]
```

### When They Ask About Compensation

**Response:**
```
Great question - here's our offer for you:

**Compensation Package:**
- Flat fee: $[X] (paid upon posting)
- Revenue share: [Y]% of all referrals from your link (ongoing passive income)
- Bonuses: $[Z] if we hit [milestone] through your link

**Why this structure:**
We want you to benefit from both the immediate post AND the long-term impact. Some of our partners are still earning monthly from posts they made months ago.

Does this work for you? We can adjust slightly based on what matters most to you (higher upfront vs. higher revenue share).

[Your Name]
```

---

### When They Ask About Time Commitment

**Response:**
```
Super reasonable question! Here's the realistic breakdown:

**Time Commitment:**
- Review partnership details: 15 minutes
- Create content: [realistic time - 30 min to 2 hours depending on format]
- Revisions (if needed): 15-30 minutes
- Posting & engagement: 10 minutes

**Total: [X] hours max**

And the best part - after you post, we handle everything. You just watch the impact numbers roll in.

Does that seem manageable with your schedule?

[Your Name]
```

---

### When They Want to See Examples

**Response:**
```
Absolutely! Here are some examples of how other partners have shared FOR THE KIDS:

**Example 1 - [Influencer Name] ([Platform]):**
[Link to their post]
[Brief description of their approach]
Result: [X] clicks, [Y] conversions

**Example 2 - [Influencer Name] ([Platform]):**
[Link to their post]
[Brief description of their approach]
Result: [X] clicks, [Y] conversions

**Key takeaway:** There's no "right" way to do this. Both of these worked because they felt authentic to each creator's style.

How would YOU want to approach it?

[Your Name]
```

---

### When They Ask About Editorial Control

**Response:**
```
You have FULL creative control.

Here's how we work:
1. You create content in your style
2. You send it to us for review (we only check for factual accuracy - not style)
3. If anything needs adjustment, we'll suggest it (but you make final call)
4. You post when YOU're ready

**The only non-negotiables:**
- Must mention the 60/30/10 split accurately
- Must include your tracking link
- Must not make claims we can't back up

Beyond that? It's your voice, your platform, your rules.

Sound good?

[Your Name]
```

---

### When They Say NO (Or Ignore You)

**Response After Clear "No":**
```
No problem at all - thanks for letting me know!

If anything changes or you know someone who might be interested, feel free to send them my way.

Keep doing what you're doing - love your content!

[Your Name]
```

**DO NOT:**
- Ask why they said no
- Try to convince them to change their mind
- Send them additional information unsolicited
- Take it personally

---

### When They Say "Not Right Now"

**Response:**
```
Totally understand - timing isn't always right!

Can I check back in with you in [timeframe - usually 1-3 months]? We'll have some new things launching that might be a better fit.

In the meantime, if you want to stay updated, here's our [newsletter/IG/etc.] so you can see what we're up to.

Thanks for considering it!

[Your Name]
```

---

### When They Ask if It's a Scam

**Response:**
```
Legit question - there are a lot of scams out there. Here's how you can verify we're real:

? Our website: [URL]
? Our verified charity partners: [Links to partner verification]
? Our Kickstarter: [Link] (Kickstarter vets all projects)
? Our founder: [LinkedIn profile]
? Our smart contracts: [Link to blockchain verification if applicable]
? Other partners: [Name 2-3 credible partners who've worked with you]

Happy to jump on a video call too if that would make you more comfortable. Or if you want to talk to [other influencer partner], I can intro you.

Does that help?

[Your Name]
```

---

### When They Have Questions About the Charity Model

**Response:**
```
Great question - transparency is huge for us.

**How the 60/30/10 split works:**
- 60% to verified pediatric charities (we work with Children's Hospital LA, St. Jude's, and others)
- 30% to infrastructure (AWS, Stripe, developers, etc.)
- 10% to the founder

**Why this model:**
Most businesses give 0-5% to charity. We built charity INTO the business model. It's called Gospel V1.3 - our ethics override.

**Verification:**
Every dollar is tracked. We publish quarterly impact reports. If you partner with us, you'll get your own impact dashboard showing exactly where the money went.

**The charities:**
[List of verified partners with links to their websites]

Want me to send you our full transparency report?

[Your Name]
```

---

### When They Want to Negotiate Terms

**Response:**
```
I appreciate you being upfront! Let's figure out something that works for both of us.

Our standard offer is [standard terms], but here's what we can flex on:
- Flat fee: We can go up to $[max]
- Revenue share: We can do up to [max]%
- Content deliverables: We can reduce to [minimum]
- Timeline: We're flexible on when you post

What would make this a YES for you?

[Your Name]
```

**Negotiation Tips:**
- Have a max you can offer before talking to them
- Be willing to walk away if they ask for too much
- Prioritize long-term partners over one-off posts
- Smaller influencers with high engagement > large influencers with low engagement

---

### When They Ask About Exclusivity

**Response:**
```
Good question!

**Our ask:**
We're NOT asking for exclusive rights to your platform or content. You can work with whoever you want.

**The only thing we ask:**
During our active campaign period ([dates]), please don't promote direct competitors (other charity-focused platforms).

After that? No restrictions at all.

Does that work for you?

[Your Name]
```

---

### When They Want to Involve Their Manager/Agent

**Response:**
```
Absolutely - professional representation is smart.

Can you intro me to [Manager name] or would you prefer I reach out directly?

I'll send over:
- Formal partnership proposal
- Contract terms
- Compensation structure
- Impact transparency reports

What's the best way to get this to them?

[Your Name]
[Title]
[Email]
[Phone]
```

Thanks!
[Your Name]
```

**Follow-Up (Day 14 - Final):**
```
[Name] -

## ADVANCED TACTICS

### The "Soft Ask" Approach
**Use when:** Testing interest before formal pitch

```
Hey [Name] - random question:

If you could promote something where 60% of the revenue went directly to kids' hospitals, would that be something your audience would care about?

Not pitching anything yet - genuinely curious about your take on this.

[Your Name]
```

**If they engage:** Follow up with full pitch
**If they don't:** You didn't burn the bridge with a hard sell

---

### The "Social Proof" Approach
**Use when:** You have credible partners to name-drop

```
[Name] -

Quick heads up: [Well-known influencer] just partnered with us on FOR THE KIDS (60% of revenue to kids' charities).

Want details?

[Your Name]
```

---

### The "Reciprocity" Approach
**Use when:** You can offer value first

```
Hey [Name]!

I run FOR THE KIDS and saw you're working on [their project/goal].

I shared your [post/video] with my network because I think what you're doing is important. No ask - just wanted to support.

If you ever want to chat about [topic related to your platform], happy to brainstorm. I've got some ideas that might help.

Cheers,
[Your Name]
```

**Then 3-5 days later:**
```
[Name] - following up on my last message.

Since we talked, I wanted to mention FOR THE KIDS (60% to charities). Given your interest in [topic], thought it might be worth exploring a partnership.

No pressure - but lmk if you want details!

[Your Name]
```

---

### The "Challenge" Approach
**Use when:** Targeting competitive influencers

```
[Name] -

Challenge: Think you could help us raise $10K for children's hospitals in the next 30 days?

**This is Gospel V1.3 - our ethics override. Non-negotiable.**
