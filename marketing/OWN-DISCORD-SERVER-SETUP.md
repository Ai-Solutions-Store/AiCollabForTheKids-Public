# FOR THE KIDS - Own Discord Server Setup Guide

**Mission:** 60% of revenue to Verified Pediatric Charities (Gospel V1.3)
**Campaign URL:** https://aidoesitall.website
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-17

## OVERVIEW: Why Build Your Own Server?

Joining existing communities is essential, but your own server becomes the hub:

| Community Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Existing Communities | Earn trust, find users, build evangelists |
| Own Discord Server | Convert evangelists into core team, deep engagement, product feedback |

Your server is where community becomes movement.

---

## PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (First 7 Days)

### Step 1: Create the Server

**On Discord:**
1. Click "+" icon to create new server
2. Name: "FOR THE KIDS Community" or "FOR THE KIDS Builders" (your choice)
3. Select "Start from scratch"
4. Accept default settings

**Server Name Considerations:**
- "FOR THE KIDS Community" = broader, includes supporters
- "FOR THE KIDS Builders" = narrower, emphasizes action
- "FOR THE KIDS Evangelists" = high-signal, only committed advocates
- "Gospel V1.3" = very niche, for deep believers

---

### Step 2: Set Server Theme & Description

**Server Settings → Server Information**

**Server Name:** FOR THE KIDS Community

**Description:**
"Community building sustainable funding for pediatric charities through AI platform revenue sharing. Gospel V1.3: 60% to verified 501(c)(3) pediatric charities, 30% infrastructure, 10% founder.

Join us: https://aidoesitall.website"

**Server Icon:** Use FOR THE KIDS logo/branding

**Verification Level:** Low (to allow members to join and participate)

---

### Step 3: Create Core Channels

---

---

### Step 5: Gospel V1.3 Channel Setup

**In `#gospel-v13`, pin this message:**

---

**Gospel V1.3: The Complete Framework**

**The Commitment:**
- 60% of FOR THE KIDS revenue → verified 501(c)(3) pediatric charities
- 30% → infrastructure, scaling, operations
- 10% → founder sustainability (preventing burnout)

**Why These Numbers?**

**60% to Charity:**
- Most nonprofits operate on feast/famine cycles
- Pediatric care is underfunded relative to adult medicine
- Sustainable, predictable funding > one-time contributions
- This is the maximum we can give while maintaining operation

**30% to Infrastructure:**
- Servers, hiring, product development
- Marketing and growth
- Customer support and reliability
- Can't grow charity impact without growth infrastructure

**10% to Founder:**
- 80% of charity startups fail in year 3 (founder burnout)
- Zero allocation = requires existing wealth (inequality)
- 10% = minimum for founder to not need outside employment
- Not extractive, not poverty-level

**The Immutable Law:**
These percentages are not suggestions. They're enforced by:
- Smart contract architecture (blockchain-verified)
- Monthly public reporting
- Quarterly third-party audit
- Community governance input

**Gospel vs. Aspirational:**
- Aspirational: "We hope to give 60%"
- Gospel V1.3: "We literally cannot give less than 60%"

This is the difference between our platform and competitors.

**Questions or Challenges?**
We want your scrutiny. The stronger our Gospel, the better.

---

### Step 6: Set Channel Permissions

**For `#announcements`:**
- Admins: Can send messages, read
- Members: Can only read

**For `#gospel-v13`:**
- Everyone: Can read and react
- Members: Can't post (keeps it clean reference material)
- Admins: Can pin important discussions to `#news-updates`

**For everything else:**
- Members: Can read, write, react

---

## PHASE 2: ROLES & MODERATION (Days 7-14)

### Create Discord Roles

**Founder/Core Team Role**

### Moderation Standards

**Be Removed/Warned For:**

- Harassment of community members
- Promoting competing platforms

**Be Celebrated For:**
- Asking tough questions about our model
- Challenging us thoughtfully
- Contributing ideas
- Helping other members
- Creating content about FOR THE KIDS

**Moderation Philosophy:**
- Fast to remove spam, slow to remove questions
- Always explain removals (DM the person)
- Assume good intent
- Second chances for well-meaning misunderstandings

---

### Create Moderation Guidelines

**Post as pinned message in `#moderator-chat`:**

1. **Spam = Immediate removal**
   - Generic "check this out" posts with link
   - Repeated same message
   - Unrelated product promotions

2. **Disputes = Conversation first**
   - Disagreements about Gospel V1.3 are welcome
   - Debate is healthy
   - Personal attacks are not

3. **Misinformation = Correction + education**
   - If someone gets numbers wrong, correct gently
   - Link them to `#gospel-v13` reference material
   - Assume ignorance, not malice

4. **Charity Talk = Always welcome**
   - Questions about charity partners? Great.
   - Suggestions for new partners? We listen.
   - Skepticism about allocation? Makes us stronger.

5. **Escalation Path:**
   - Warn → Timeout (24h) → Timeout (7 days) → Ban

---

## PHASE 3: CONTENT & ENGAGEMENT (Weeks 2-4)

### Regular Content Calendar

**Daily Posts:**
- Check `#wins` for celebrations
- Respond to member questions within 6 hours
- Monitor `#feedback` for urgent issues

**Weekly Posts:**
- **Monday:** Week kick-off (what team is working on)
- **Wednesday:** Mid-week check-in or Gospel deep-dive
- **Friday:** Week recap + member highlights

**Bi-Weekly Posts:**
- Impact update (`#impact-tracking`): Charity allocations, revenue growth
- New partnership announcement (if applicable)
- Product update or feature announcement

**Monthly Posts:**
- Full impact report: Revenue, allocation, charity outcomes
- Community metrics: Member growth, engagement
- Founder reflection (why you're doing this, what's hard, what's working)

---

### Seed with Initial Content

**Week 1 Goals:**
- 3-5 posts from founder explaining context
- Welcome 10-20 early members
- Build 2-3 conversations going
- Establish rhythm

**Example Week 1 Posts:**

**Monday:**
"Hey everyone - starting a space specifically for people who believe business and impact aren't mutually exclusive. Excited to have you here. First question: what made you join? Drop a message in #introductions and tell us your story."

**Wednesday:**
"Some people ask: 'Why is the founder taking 10%?' Good question. Let me break down the math. 80% of charity startups die in year 3 because founders burn out. Here's why 10% is the minimum viable allocation..."

**Friday:**
"End of week 1 - we've got 15 members, some amazing conversations in #gospel-v13. One theme I'm seeing: people want MORE transparency, not less. So here's what we're doing next month..."

---

### First Major Initiative: "Introduce Yourself"

**In `#introductions`, post:**

"Tell us:
1. What's your background?
2. Why did you join FOR THE KIDS community?
3. What would you like to work on (if anything)?
4. What would make this community valuable to you?

No elevator pitch needed. Just genuine intro."

**Respond personally to every introduction.**

This builds trust faster than anything.

---

## PHASE 4: COMMUNITY-BUILDING EVENTS (Weeks 3+)

---

**Gospel Debate Challenge:**

---

## PHASE 5: CONVERT COMMUNITY INTO MOVEMENT (Ongoing)

### Identify & Empower Evangelists

**Evangelist Signals:**
- Asks thoughtful questions
- Challenges you constructively
- Contributes ideas
- Defends Gospel V1.3 to skeptics
- Shows up consistently

**Action when you identify evangelist:**
1. DM them: "I notice you really understand and care about what we're doing. Interested in being official evangelist?"
2. Give them Evangelist role
3. Ask: "What would help you evangelize?"
4. Provide:
   - Talking points
   - Social media graphics
   - Draft posts they can share
   - Direct support from you

**Evangelist Perks:**
- Early access to features
- Monthly 1:1 with founder
- Featured in "Community Spotlight"
- Invitation to private strategy calls

---

### Create Community Content

**Encourage members to create:**
- Blog posts about why they joined
- Videos explaining Gospel V1.3
- Social media content
- Referral materials
- Integration tutorials

**Share everything they create:**
- Repost to FOR THE KIDS social media
- Feature in `#integration-showcase`
- Link from main website
- Compensate (discount, credit, or cash)

---

### Build Charity Partnerships Through Community

**Goal:** Community becomes recruitment channel for charity partnerships

**Process:**
1. "Do you know a pediatric charity we should partner with?"
2. Community nominates organizations
3. You evaluate and reach out
4. Nominating member becomes "partnership champion"
5. If it works, celebrate them publicly

**This Signals:**
- We actually listen to community
- Community shapes our impact direction
- Members have real influence

---

### Create Referral System

**In Discord:** Set up bot or manual tracking
- Member refers → signup mentions referrer → discount/credit given
- Track: "X new members referred by Y"
- Monthly: "Top referrers this month"

**Public acknowledgment matters more than discounts:**
- "Thanks to [Evangelist], we got 5 new members"
- Recognition = more valuable than cash

---

## CHANNEL OPTIMIZATION BY PHASE

### Month 1 (Founding)
- Keep it simple: 6-8 channels
- High founder presence
- Focus on building culture

### Month 2-3 (Growth)
- Add 3-5 channels based on what's happening
- Less daily founder presence, more community leadership
- Moderators become more visible

### Month 4+ (Maturation)
- 15-20 channels, organized by category
- Founder presence: weekly/monthly
- Community runs most conversations
- Evangelists lead discussions

---

---

## RED FLAGS & COURSE CORRECTIONS

**If server feels empty after 2 weeks:**
- Post more frequently (daily if needed)
- Ask more questions
- Highlight good member contributions
- Don't let it become founder monologue
- Better to have 3 active members than 30 silent ones

**If conversations turn negative:**
- Don't ban immediately - engage
- Ask "what would make this better?"
- If it's about Gospel V1.3, you probably need to strengthen it
- If it's about product, take the feedback seriously

**If members aren't referring others:**
- Ask directly: "What would make you want to invite your friends?"
- May not be addressing their actual needs
- Recalibrate

**If Evangelists go quiet:**
- Check in: "Noticed you haven't been around. Everything okay?"
- They might be busy or lost interest - that's fine
- Don't guilt trip

---

## SCALING GUIDELINES

**At 100 members:**
- You might need a co-moderator
- Add more channels to keep organized
- Community can mostly handle itself

**At 500 members:**
- Need 2-3 moderators
- Establish clearer guidelines
- Community leadership structure
- Some channels get too noisy - split them

**At 1,000 members:**
- Full moderation team
- Bot automation for rules
- Community council/steering committee
- This is now a significant asset

---

## GOLDEN RULES FOR YOUR SERVER

1. **Authenticity first** - Be real about challenges, not just wins
2. **Community over control** - Let conversations happen, don't script them
3. **Gospel V1.3 is foundation, not promotion** - Explain it, defend it, let community own it
4. **Charity impact must be visible** - Share metrics, celebrate outcomes
5. **Evangelist empowerment** - Best members become voices, not just audience
6. **Feedback loops matter** - Community shapes product and direction
7. **Consistency builds trust** - Weekly presence > sporadic activity
8. **Celebrate community wins** - Their success is your success
