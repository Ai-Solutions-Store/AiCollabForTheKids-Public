## STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK

### Core Principle

Communities are networks of trust. FOR THE KIDS works by integrating into existing community structures rather than trying to replace them.

### Three-Layer Model

```
LAYER 1: AWARENESS
?
"There's a business where 60% goes to kids"
- Grassroots word of mouth
- Social media posts
- Community announcements

LAYER 2: NORMALIZATION
?
"My neighbor is using it. My church is recommending it."
- Social proof
- Peer recommendations
- Institutional endorsements

LAYER 3: INTEGRATION
?
"Using FOR THE KIDS is what our community does"
- Community challenges
- Collective goal-setting
- Shared impact tracking
```

### Success Metrics

- **Awareness:** % of community members aware of FOR THE KIDS
- **Adoption:** % of community members using FOR THE KIDS
- **Engagement:** % of users participating in community tracking
- **Sustainability:** Monthly revenue retention rate

### The Compounding Effect

```
Month 1: 10 members, $1,000 revenue, $600 to kids
Month 2: 15 members, $1,800 revenue, $1,080 to kids (word spreads)
Month 3: 25 members, $3,200 revenue, $1,920 to kids (network effect)
Month 6: 60 members, $8,000 revenue, $4,800 to kids (critical mass)
```
