## 1. EXPLAINER VIDEO (2 MIN)

### Full Platform Explanation

**SCRIPT:**

[0:00-0:15] HOOK
"What if every time you bought something online, 60% of the profit went directly to sick kids? Not 'a portion.' Not 'proceeds.' Sixty percent. Guaranteed. Verifiable. Immutable."

[VISUAL: Animated split showing 60/30/10 breakdown]

[0:15-0:30] PROBLEM
"Right now, when companies say they 'support charity,' they usually mean 1-5%. Maybe less. And you can't verify where it actually goes. We're changing that forever."

[VISUAL: Traditional charity model vs FOR THE KIDS model comparison]

[0:30-1:00] SOLUTION
"FOR THE KIDS is a platform where 60% of every single transaction is automatically split to verified pediatric charities. Not later. Not 'eventually.' Instantly. Through smart contracts on the blockchain."

[VISUAL: Screen recording showing transaction split in real-time]

"30% covers infrastructure and growth. 10% goes to the founder. That's it. That's Gospel V1.3, and it's written into the code. It can't be changed."

[1:00-1:30] HOW IT WORKS
"Buy a t-shirt for $30. $18 goes directly to St. Jude, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, or whichever verified charity you choose. You get proof of your impact. They get funding without overhead."

[VISUAL: User journey animation - browse, buy, impact receipt]

"We're launching with merchandise, but this is infrastructure. Any business can plug in. Imagine your favorite coffee shop, your gym, your local bookstore - all sending 60% to kids who need it."

[1:30-1:45] SOCIAL PROOF
"Backed by blockchain technology, audited by our community, and growing every day. Join thousands who are redefining what it means to shop with purpose."

[VISUAL: Backer count, transaction counter, charity logos]

[1:45-2:00] CTA
"Back us on Kickstarter. Every dollar you pledge puts us closer to launch. And yes, 60% of our Kickstarter profits go to the kids too. Because that's how we roll."

## 3. FOUNDER STORY (3 MIN)

### Personal Journey Narrative

**SCRIPT:**

[0:00-0:20] HOOK
"I'm Josh Coleman. I'm a dad, a developer, and I'm building something that could change millions of lives. But this story doesn't start with me. It starts with my kids."

[VISUAL: Photos of Josh with his children]

[0:20-0:45] THE MOMENT
"Three years ago, my daughter asked me why we couldn't help the sick kids she saw on TV. I gave her the usual answer: 'We allocate when we can, honey.' But that night, I couldn't sleep."

[VISUAL: Father-daughter moment, hospital exterior b-roll]

[0:45-1:15] THE QUESTION
"I started thinking: What if we didn't contribute when we can? What if every single thing we bought helped those kids? What if it was automatic, guaranteed, and you could see exactly where your money went?"

"So I started researching. Turns out, most 'charity' products give less than 5% to actual causes. Some give nothing. They just use 'giving back' as marketing."

[VISUAL: Statistics, charts showing typical charity percentages]

[1:15-1:45] THE DECISION
"I'm a blockchain developer. I know how to make transactions transparent and immutable. So I made a decision: I was going to build a platform where 60% - yes, sixty percent - goes directly to verified pediatric charities. Every time. No exceptions."

"My friends said I was crazy. 'You can't give away 60%!' But that's exactly the point. This isn't about maximizing MY profit. It's about maximizing THEIR impact."

[VISUAL: Josh at computer, early sketches, whiteboard sessions]

[1:45-2:15] THE SACRIFICE
"I took less. The Gospel V1.3 revenue split is 60% to kids, 30% to infrastructure, 10% to me. I moved 10% from my pocket to theirs. Because if I'm asking you to trust this platform, I need to prove I'm serious."

"I've been working 16-hour days for months. I've invested my own money. I've brought in AI developers, blockchain experts, and charity partners. This is real."

[VISUAL: Late-night coding sessions, team meetings, infrastructure work]

[2:15-2:45] THE VISION
"FOR THE KIDS isn't just a store. It's infrastructure. Any business can plug in and send 60% of their revenue to verified charities. Imagine your favorite brands all giving more than they take."

"We're launching on Kickstarter with merchandise. But this is just the beginning. We're building a movement."

[VISUAL: Platform demo, future vision animations]

[2:45-3:00] THE ASK
"I can't do this alone. I need you. Back us on Kickstarter. Buy a shirt. Spread the word. Help me answer my daughter's question: 'Dad, why can't we help those kids?'"

"Now we can. FOR THE KIDS. Always 60%. Always transparent. Always verifiable."

[0:00-0:10] HOOK
"Everyone asks: Why 60%? Isn't that too much?"
[Visual: Josh talking head]

[0:10-0:30] EXPLANATION
"Here's the thing: Most 'charity' brands give 1-5%. They use 'giving back' as marketing but keep 95%+ for themselves. I wanted to do the opposite. What if we gave MORE than we kept?"
[Visual: Charts showing industry standards vs FOR THE KIDS]

[0:30-0:45] THE MATH
"60% to kids. 30% to keep the platform running. 10% to me. I took LESS so they get MORE. That's Gospel V1.3, and it's written into our smart contracts. It literally cannot be changed."

[0:15-0:45] MORNING: PLANNING
"First thing: Check the fleet status. Our T5500 server runs the blockchain node. Sabertooth handles the admin panel. EC2 hosts the API. Everything has to be green before I write a single line of code."
[Visual: Screen recordings of fleet status dashboard, terminal commands]

[0:45-1:15] MID-MORNING: DEVELOPMENT
"Today I'm working on the financial transparency review. Every transaction needs to split perfectly: 60% to charity, 30% to infrastructure, 10% to me. One decimal place off and the whole Gospel V1.3 promise breaks."
[Visual: Code editor, smart contract debugging, testing transactions]

[1:15-1:45] LUNCH: MARKETING

[Visual: Error logs, terminal debugging, frustrated but focused]

[2:45-3:15] EVENING: COMMUNITY
"Discord office hours. Backers have questions. Skeptics have concerns. I answer everything. Transparency isn't just about the blockchain - it's about showing up."
[Visual: Discord chat, typing responses, community engagement]

[3:15-3:45] NIGHT: DOCUMENTATION

[Visual: Markdown file editing, git commit, pushing to repo]

[3:45-4:00] CLOSE

## 10. FAQ VIDEO SERIES

### 10 Common Questions Answered

### FAQ 1: "How do I know the money actually goes to charity?"

**SCRIPT (60-90 seconds):**

[0:00-0:15] QUESTION
"Number one question: How do I know 60% actually goes to charity? Fair question. Here's the answer."

[0:15-0:45] ANSWER
"Every transaction triggers a smart contract on the blockchain. The moment your payment clears, 60% is automatically sent to verified charity wallets. You get a receipt with the transaction hash. You can look it up on the blockchain explorer and SEE your money in the charity's wallet."

[Visual: Screen recording showing transaction ? smart contract ? beneficiary allocation]

[0:45-1:00] TRUST
"We don't hold your contribution. We don't 'send it later.' It's instant, automatic, and verifiable by anyone, anywhere. That's what blockchain transparency means."

[Visual: Blockchain explorer, transaction verification]

**CTA:** "More questions? Check the description."

---

### FAQ 2: "Why 60%? Why not 100%?"

**SCRIPT (60-90 seconds):**

[0:00-0:15] QUESTION
"Why not give 100% to charity? Because that's not sustainable."

[0:15-0:45] ANSWER
"To run a platform, we need infrastructure: servers, payment processing, inventory, customer support, marketing. That's the 30%. If we tried to run on 0%, we'd go bankrupt in a month and help no one."

[0:45-1:00] COMPARISON
"Most 'charity brands' give 1-5% and keep 95%. We give 60% and keep 40%. We're flipping the script. We're prioritizing kids over profits, but staying sustainable."

**CTA:** "60% is the most we can give and still exist."

---

### FAQ 3: "Which charities do you support?"

**SCRIPT (60-90 seconds):**

[0:00-0:15] QUESTION
"Which charities get the 60%? Great question."

[0:15-0:45] ANSWER
"We partner with verified pediatric charities: St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Ronald McDonald House, and more. Every charity goes through our verification process: tax-exempt status, financial transparency, direct pediatric impact."

[Visual: Charity logos, verification checklist]

[0:45-1:00] CHOICE
"When you shop, YOU choose which charity gets your 60%. We're building a dashboard so you can see exactly which organizations you've supported."

**CTA:** "Your purchase. Your choice. Your impact."

---

### FAQ 4: "Is this a tax write-off for me?"

**SCRIPT (60-90 seconds):**

[0:00-0:15] QUESTION

[0:45-1:00] PERMANENCE

[0:45-1:00] TRANSPARENCY
"That's why we built this on blockchain. Trust is earned through transparency, not marketing. Check our work. Then decide."
