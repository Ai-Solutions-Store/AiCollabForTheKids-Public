## PART 3: LOCATION & ENVIRONMENT

### Best Locations

**Setup:**
- Clear background (remove clutter)

---

**Option 2: Home Office or Personal Space**

- Easy for remote customers
- Can show personal side
- Comfortable environment

**Setup:**
- Simple background (bookshelf, plant, branded items)
- Avoid cluttered or unprofessional-looking spaces
- Good natural light preferred
- Clean up desk/immediate area

---

**Option 3: Studio Setup at Home**
- Professional looking
- Controlled environment
- Consistent lighting
- Brand-aligned background

**Setup:**
- Buy/borrow backdrop ($20-100): solid color or branded
- Position backdrop 3-4 feet behind subject
- Place subject 3-4 feet in front of backdrop
- Lighting: soft key light + fill light
- Professional appearance without travel

---

### Location Quality Checklist

- [ ] Background is clean, professional, or authentic
- [ ] Adequate lighting (no harsh shadows)
- [ ] No harsh backlighting (avoid windows behind subject)
- [ ] Quiet environment (test audio)
- [ ] Space for camera 6-10 feet away
- [ ] Room for subject to move/gesture naturally
- [ ] Neutral or branded color scheme
- [ ] No distracting elements entering frame
- [ ] Appropriate for subject's industry
- [ ] Subject looks comfortable in space

---

## PART 4: LIGHTING FOR VIDEO

### Natural Light (Best & Free)

**Best Practice:**
- Position subject facing window (indirect light)
- Avoid direct sun (creates harsh shadows)
- Overcast days ideal (soft diffuse light)
- Side lighting flatters face more than direct frontal
- Time of day matters: golden hour best
- Avoid recording with window behind (backlighting)

**Setup:**
- Subject 3-4 feet from window
- Camera between subject and window (or angled)
- Use white surface to bounce light (reflector, poster board)
- Fill shadows with reflector on opposite side

---

### Artificial Light (Professional)

**If no good natural light:**

**Budget Option ($30-50):**
- 2 clip lamps with daylight bulbs (5500K)
- White poster board for reflection/diffusion
- Position: 45-degree angles, 4-5 feet away

**Better Option ($100-300):**
- 2 LED panel lights (Neewer, Walimex brands)
- Tripod stands
- Softboxes for diffusion
- Dimmable for intensity control

**Professional ($500+):**
- 3-light kit (key, fill, backlight)
- Studio lights with stands
- Softboxes and reflectors
- Dimmers and gels

---

### Lighting Setup Formula

**Key Light:** Main light source
- 45-degree angle from camera
- 4-5 feet from subject
- Creates dimension

**Fill Light:** Reduces shadows
- Opposite side of key light
- Slightly dimmer
- Bounces or secondary light

**Backlight:** Separates subject from background
- Behind subject, above
- Creates rim light
- Adds depth and dimension

**Result:** Three-dimensional, flattering light

---

## PART 5: AUDIO QUALITY (Critical)

### Best Practices

**Position microphone:**
- 6-12 inches from mouth
- Slightly below chin level
- Pointing at mouth

**Use external microphone if possible:**
- Built-in phone mics are poor
- Cheap lavalier mic ($20-50) is huge upgrade
- USB mics for computer recording
- Wireless mics for mobility

**Minimize background noise:**
- Quiet room (no AC, traffic, dogs)
- Turn off notifications
- Silence phones
- No fans running
- Soft furnishings absorb sound
- Door closed

**Test audio levels:**
- Do a 30-second test recording
- Play back to check clarity
- Adjust mic position if needed
- Check for hum or interference

### Common Audio Problems & Fixes

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Muffled sound | Mic too far | Move closer |
| Too loud/distorted | Mic too close or volume too high | Back up or lower volume |
| Background hum | AC interference or ground loop | Move away from AC, use different outlet |
| Wind noise | Outdoor recording | Use windscreen foam |
| Echo/reverb | Hard surfaces | Add soft furnishings, blankets |
| Inconsistent level | Movement | Stay still or use automatic level |

---

## PART 6: CAMERA & FRAMING

### Camera Settings

**Resolution:**
- 1080p minimum (Full HD)
- 4K if camera supports (future-proofs)
- Landscape orientation preferred (16:9)

**Frame Rate:**
- 30fps standard
- 24fps for cinematic look
- 60fps for slow-motion possibilities

**Stabilization:**
- Use tripod (non-negotiable)
- Enable stabilization if available
- Don't hand-hold unless movement intentional

**Focus:**
- Auto-focus on subject's eyes
- Manual focus on iris (sharper)
- Test before recording
- Keep face in focus throughout

---

### Framing & Composition

**The Rule of Thirds:**
- Place eyes in upper third
- Headroom above head (1 inch)
- Space in front of face (where they look)
- Subject slightly off-center (more dynamic)

**Head Position:**
- Look directly at camera (conversational)
- Or look slightly up (powerful)
- Eye contact critical for connection

**Body Position:**
- Straight on: formal, direct
- 45-degree angle: conversational, natural
- Slight lean forward: engaged, interested

**Framing Options:**
- Tight: Head and shoulders (intimate)
- Medium: Head to waist (personal)
- Wide: Full body (context)
- Best: Start medium, move between if possible

---

### Camera Angles

**Eye Level (Best):**
- Camera at same level as eyes
- Creates connection
- Most flattering

**Slightly Above (Flattering):**
- Softens jawline
- More flattering angles
- Slightly looking up (submissive)

**Below Eye Level (Powerful):**
- Looking down at camera
- More authoritative
- Use sparingly

**Avoid:** Looking down into camera (unflattering)

---
