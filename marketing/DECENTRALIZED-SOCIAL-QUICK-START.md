## RESPONSE TEMPLATES (Copy/Paste Ready)

### "How is this different from other charities?"
**THREADS:** "We're not a charity - we're a PLATFORM. 60% of revenue (not contributions) flows to charities via smart contracts. As we grow, so do contributions. Compound impact."

**BLUESKY:** "Revenue-generating business model. As platform scales, 60% automatically flows to charities via smart contracts. That's the difference - we're architecting impact, not asking for it."

**MASTODON:** "Different model: we generate revenue and allocate 60% automatically. Most charities lose 20-40% to overhead. We hardcode the allocation via smart contract - no trust needed, just verification."

### "How do we know you won't change the split?"
**THREADS:** "Gospel V1.3 is hardcoded via smart contract on Base Mainnet. It's not a promise - it's CODE. Verify it yourself on BaseScan: [link]"

**BLUESKY:** "Smart contract: Planned (Q1 2026). Base Mainnet. Immutable. You can verify it on BaseScan right now. That's the whole point of decentralization."

**MASTODON:** "planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing). Don't trust - verify. BaseScan address: [contract]. Public ledger. No human can change this - it's code, not culture."

## CRISIS PROTOCOL (If Skepticism Arises)

**Universal Approach:**
1. Assume good faith (healthy skepticism is good)
2. Address concern directly
3. Provide verification/proof
4. Invite continued conversation
5. Never argue - educate

**Key Points to Make:**
- "60% isn't a promise, it's CODE"
- "Verify, don't trust. Here's the smart contract: [address]"
- "We built this to FIX the charity trust problem"
- "The founder took LESS so kids get MORE"
