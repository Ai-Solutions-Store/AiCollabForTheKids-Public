## GUEST BIO & ONE-SHEET

### GUEST: JOSHUA COLEMAN

**Title:** Founder & CEO, FOR THE KIDS / AIDoesItAll.Website
**Location:** Florida, USA (EST/EDT)
**Available:** Remote interviews (Zoom, Riverside, SquadCast, StreamYard)
**Preferred Format:** 30-60 minute conversational interviews

---

### SHORT BIO (50 words)

Joshua Coleman is the founder of AIDoesItAll.Website, an AI platform that guarantees 60% of all revenue goes to Verified Pediatric Charities via DAO-enforced smart contracts. He reduced his own compensation from 20% to 10% (Gospel V1.3 - Ethics Override) so kids could receive more. The platform uses blockchain transparency and AI governance to eliminate mission drift.

---

### LONG BIO (150 words)

Joshua Coleman built FOR THE KIDS after discovering that traditional charities often allocate less than 50% of contributions to actual programs. Frustrated by opacity and overhead, he created AIDoesItAll.Website—an AI platform where 60% of every dollar AUTOMATICALLY goes to Verified Pediatric Charities through DAO smart contracts on the Base blockchain.

What makes this unique: Joshua intentionally reduced his founder share from 20% to 10% (the "Ethics Override" in Gospel V1.3) so children could receive 60% instead of 50%. No human—including Joshua—can override this split. The platform is governed by an "AI Board of Directors" including Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google), and Grok (xAI), who make operational decisions enforced by immutable code.

To date, the platform has allocated thousands to children's hospitals with full blockchain transparency. Joshua is proving that profit and charity can be mathematically inseparable—and that code enforcement beats human promises.

### 1. HOW I BUILT THIS (NPR) - Guy Raz

**Audience:** 10M+ listeners | Entrepreneurs & innovators
**Contact:** hibt@npr.org
**Website:** npr.org/podcasts/510313/how-i-built-this
**Best Pitch Angle:** The AI Platform That Governs Itself

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: Guest Pitch - The AI Platform Built BY AI (60% to Kids)

Hi Guy,

I didn't build a traditional company. I built something that builds itself.

Here's the origin story for How I Built This:

After failing to change the world through traditional business, I made a radical decision: Let AI run the company. Not "assist"—RUN it.

- Claude (Anthropic) writes ALL production code
- Gemini (Google) validates business logic
- Grok (xAI) manages infrastructure
- Smart contracts enforce 60% charity allocation automatically

I'm the founder, but the AI makes most decisions. And it's working:
- Thousands allocated to children's hospitals
- Zero mission drift (code prevents it)
- Platform runs 24/7 without me

The wildest part? I reduced my share from 20% to 10% because the AI calculated kids should get more. I took less so kids could get 60% instead of 50%.

Your How I Built This audience has never heard an origin story like this—because companies like this don't exist yet.

Happy to discuss:
- The moment I decided to let AI govern
- How the "AI Board of Directors" makes decisions
- Why I trust code more than humans
- Building a business designed to run for 100 years

Available for remote interview. 45-60 minutes works great.

FOR THE KIDS,
Joshua Coleman

### 2. THE TIM FERRISS SHOW - Tim Ferriss

**Audience:** 800M+ downloads | Optimization & systems thinking
**Contact:** tim.blog/contact
**Website:** tim.blog/podcast
**Best Pitch Angle:** The Anti-Exit Startup—Built to Run Forever

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: The Anti-Exit Startup - Optimized for Immortality, Not Acquisition

Tim,

Most founders optimize for exit. I optimized for immortality.

AIDoesItAll.Website is an AI platform designed to:
- Never be acquired (DAO governance prevents it)
- Never go public (mission lock prevents it)
- Never stop giving (smart contracts enforce it)
- Run for 100+ years without me

The result? A business that:
- Contributes 60% of revenue to Verified Pediatric Charities
- Governed by AI (Claude/Gemini/Grok make decisions)
- Enforced by blockchain (Base Mainnet smart contracts)
- Scales without traditional management

I took LESS (10% vs. 20%) so kids get MORE (60% vs. 50%).

Your audience would appreciate the systems thinking:
- How to build a business that outlives you
- Why code governance beats human boards
- Multi-model AI orchestration in production
- The moment I chose immortality over exit
- DAO as permanence protocol

This isn't a startup. It's anti-fragile infrastructure.

Tech stack: 184GB RAM bare metal cluster, Claude Opus 4.5 writing production code, Base blockchain for immutability, federated AI governance model.

Available for deep-dive conversation (60-90 min ideal).

Best,

### 3. MASTERS OF SCALE - Reid Hoffman

**Audience:** Silicon Valley leaders & scaling entrepreneurs
**Contact:** mastersofscale.com/contact
**Website:** mastersofscale.com
**Best Pitch Angle:** Scaling Charity at Software Speed

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: Scaling Charity at Software Speed - 60% to Kids via DAO

Reid,

Question: How do you scale charitable impact without scaling overhead?

Answer: Make charity THE PRODUCT, not a side mission.

AIDoesItAll.Website is an AI platform where:
- 60% of ALL revenue goes to Verified Pediatric Charities
- Smart contracts enforce the split (no human override)
- Blockchain provides real-time transparency
- AI governance prevents mission drift

Here's the scaling insight: Traditional charities scale linearly (more donations = more staff = more overhead). We scale exponentially—infrastructure costs decrease per transaction as we grow, but the 60% to kids NEVER decreases.

The math:
- 10,000 users at $10/month = $60K to kids monthly
- 1M users at $10/month = $6M to kids monthly
- Infrastructure cost grows logarithmically; charity impact grows linearly

Your Masters of Scale framework applies perfectly:
- "Do things that don't scale" → I manually verified first 10 charities
- "Reach escape velocity" → DAO governance automates what boards can't
- "Blitzscale responsibly" → Code ensures mission integrity at any scale

I took 10% (not 20%) so kids get 60% (not 50%). That's not charity—that's product-market fit for doing good.

Available to discuss scaling models for mission-driven platforms.

### 4. LENNY'S PODCAST - Lenny Rachitsky

**Audience:** 500K+ product managers & builders
**Contact:** lennyspodcast.com/contact
**Website:** lennyspodcast.com
**Best Pitch Angle:** Product Strategy for AI-First Social Impact

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: Product Strategy - When Charity IS the Core Product

Lenny,

Most companies treat charity as CSR (corporate social responsibility). We treat it as the core product.

Here's the product thesis:

TRADITIONAL MODEL:
- Build product → Generate profit → Allocate some to charity
- Result: Charity is optional, easily cut when times are tough

OUR MODEL:
- Build product → Smart contract ENFORCES 60% to charity → Profit is what's left
- Result: Charity is immutable, backend-enforced, impossible to remove

Product decisions this enabled:
1. **Trust as a feature** - Blockchain transparency = zero-trust verification
2. **AI governance** - Claude/Gemini/Grok make decisions (no human bias)
3. **Anti-roadmap drift** - Smart contracts prevent pivot away from mission
4. **Viral mechanic** - Every user becomes an automatic charity supporter

The result: A platform where doing good ISN'T marketing—it's the product itself.

Your audience would appreciate:
- How we chose 60/30/10 split (optimization problem)
- Why DAO governance is better than human boards
- Multi-model AI orchestration (Claude + Gemini + Grok)
- Building for 100-year time horizon vs. exit strategy

I'm a product thinker who decided to product-ify charity. Happy to go deep on architecture, decision frameworks, and tradeoffs.

Available for 45-60 min conversation.

### 5. ALL-IN PODCAST - Chamath, Jason Calacanis, Sacks, Friedberg

**Audience:** 1M+ tech leaders, investors, markets focus
**Contact:** allinpodcast.co/contact
**Website:** allinpodcast.co
**Best Pitch Angle:** DAO Governance as Competitive Advantage

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: DAO Governance Thesis - Why Smart Contracts Beat Corporate Boards

All-In Team,

Hot take: Corporate boards are obsolete for mission-driven companies.

Here's why:

PROBLEM WITH BOARDS:
- Fiduciary duty = maximize shareholder value
- Mission drift when pressure to cut costs
- No accountability mechanism for promises

DAO ALTERNATIVE:
- Smart contracts = immutable mission enforcement
- 60% to charity hardcoded (no vote can change it)
- Blockchain transparency = real-time accountability

I built AIDoesItAll.Website to test this thesis. Results so far:
- $thousands to kids (blockchain-verified)
- Zero mission drift (code prevents it)
- "AI Board of Directors" (Claude/Gemini/Grok) make operational calls
- Founder took 10% (not 20%) so kids get 60% (not 50%)

This intersects All-In's sweet spots:
- **Tech:** Multi-model AI orchestration, Base blockchain, DAO governance
- **Business models:** For-profit LLC that out-gives most nonprofits
- **Contrarian bet:** Code governance > human governance for certain use cases
- **Markets:** If this works, every mission-driven company copies it

Your audience: VCs, founders, operators who think about incentive design and governance. This is governance innovation meets social impact.

Available for remote appearance. Happy to debate the "DAO as board replacement" thesis.

### 6. LEX FRIDMAN PODCAST - Lex Fridman

**Audience:** 3M+ AI researchers, engineers, philosophers
**Contact:** lexfridman.com/contact
**Website:** lexfridman.com/podcast
**Best Pitch Angle:** AI Alignment Through Immutable Ethics

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: AI Alignment - Encoding Ethics Into Immutable Systems

Lex,

What if we could solve AI alignment not through training, but through architecture?

I'm building an AI platform where:
- Claude (Anthropic) writes production code
- Gemini (Google) validates logic
- Grok (xAI) manages infrastructure
- Smart contracts enforce "help kids" as unchangeable goal

The alignment mechanism: 60% of ALL revenue goes to Verified Pediatric Charities. This isn't a policy—it's hardcoded into Base blockchain smart contracts. No human (including me) can override it.

This creates an AI system that is:
1. **Goal-stable** - Mission cannot drift (blockchain immutability)
2. **Transparent** - Every decision auditable on public ledger
3. **Accountable** - Code enforces what humans promise
4. **Multi-agent** - Claude + Gemini + Grok consensus model

Your audience thinks deeply about:
- AI safety and alignment
- Multi-model orchestration
- Long-term thinking (this runs for 100+ years)
- Ethics in code

I'd love to discuss:
- Whether code-enforced ethics is viable AI alignment strategy
- Federated AI governance (multiple models, consensus-driven)
- The philosophy of "benevolent technocracy"
- Why I trust AI more than human boards

This is an experiment in building AI systems aligned to helping humans—specifically kids who need medical care. It's both philosophical and operational.

Available for long-form conversation (2-3 hours if useful).

### 7. 20VC (THE TWENTY MINUTE VC) - Harry Stebbings

**Audience:** 400K+ VCs and startup founders
**Contact:** 20vc.com/contact
**Website:** 20vc.com
**Best Pitch Angle:** Anti-VC Business Model That Scales

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: The Anti-VC Startup - No Investors, No Exit, Just Impact

Harry,

I built a company that VCs would never fund. And that's the point.

AIDoesItAll.Website is an AI platform that:
- Gives 60% of revenue to kids (smart contract enforced)
- Has no investors (no dilution, no exit pressure)
- Can never be acquired (DAO prevents it)
- Designed to run for 100+ years

Why VCs would hate it:
- No 10x exit potential (mission-locked)
- No pivot option (blockchain enforces 60% to kids)
- Founder takes 10% (not enough carry)

Why it works anyway:
- Sustainable at $100K annual revenue
- Scales to $100M+ without changing model
- No board pressure to compromise mission
- Infrastructure costs decrease per user (software economics)

I took 10% instead of 20% so kids get 60% instead of 50%. That's not VC-backable. But it's profitable, scalable, and permanent.

Your 20VC audience would appreciate:
- Why some businesses SHOULDN'T raise VC
- How DAO governance replaces investor boards
- Building for cash flow vs. exit
- The "anti-portfolio" thesis (what VCs miss by optimizing for exits)

This is a counterexample to "growth at all costs." It's growth with guardrails—and the guardrails are code.

Available for 20-30 min conversation.

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: Multi-Model Orchestration - Claude + Gemini + Grok in Production

Sarah & Elad,

What happens when you run multiple frontier models in production—not as alternatives, but as a federated system?

We're doing it at AIDoesItAll.Website:

ARCHITECTURE:
- **Claude (Opus 4.5):** Writes production code, system architecture

**Best Pitch Angle:** Blockchain Transparency for Nonprofit Sector

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: Blockchain Transparency for Nonprofits - Live Case Study

George,

Nonprofit donors want ONE thing: proof their money is helping.

Here's how we provide it:

AIDoesItAll.Website uses blockchain to:
- Record every transaction (immutable)
- Enforce 60% charity split (smart contracts)

- Why smart contracts are better than pledge campaigns
- Practical implementation (we're live, not theoretical)
- Cost/benefit analysis (is this worth it for smaller nonprofits?)

I'm not selling software—I'm sharing what we learned building this infrastructure. The goal: make blockchain transparency accessible to every nonprofit, not just tech companies.

Topics we could cover:
- DAO governance for mission-driven orgs
- Blockchain transparency on a budget
- AI verification of charity effectiveness
- How for-profit can outperform nonprofit structure

Available for 30-45 min interview (remote).

**Best Pitch Angle:** Building Startups with Hardcoded Values

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: YC Guest Pitch - When Your Values Are Hardcoded, Not Optional

YC Team,

Paul Graham wrote: "Do things that don't scale." I did the opposite—I hardcoded something that MUST scale.

AIDoesItAll.Website is an AI platform where:
- 60% to kids is in smart contracts (can't be changed)
- AI governance replaces human boards (Claude/Gemini/Grok)
- Built to run 100+ years (no exit strategy)

YC teaches "make something people want." We made something KIDS need—and proved you can build a profitable business that can't betray its mission.

Startup insights your founders would appreciate:
- **Launch fast:** Used Claude to write production code (10x faster)
- **Do things that don't scale:** Manually verified first charities
- **Default alive:** Profitable at $100K/year, scales to $100M+
- **Mission-lock:** DAO prevents pivot (feature, not bug)

The contrarian bet: What if some startups SHOULDN'T be VC-backed? What if mission-lock is a competitive advantage, not a limitation?

I'm a builder who chose impact over exit. Happy to share the journey.

Available for interview (30-45 min).

### 12. EXPONENTIAL VIEW - Azeem Azhar

**Audience:** 200K+ exponential tech & society thinkers
**Contact:** exponentialview.co/contact
**Website:** exponentialview.co
**Best Pitch Angle:** Exponential Tech for Exponential Good

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: Exponential Impact - AI + Blockchain + DAO for Social Good

Azeem,

Your work explores how exponential technologies reshape society. Here's a live experiment:

AIDoesItAll.Website uses:
- **AI** (Claude/Gemini/Grok) for governance and operations
- **Blockchain** (Base) for immutable transparency
- **Smart contracts** for enforcing 60% to kids automatically

The thesis: Exponential tech can create exponential social impact—IF we design the right incentive structures.

Why this matters:
- Traditional charities scale linearly (more donors = more overhead)
- Our model scales exponentially (tech costs ↓ per user, charity % stays 60%)
- Result: As we grow, MORE goes to kids, not less

Your Exponential View audience thinks about second-order effects. Here are ours:
- **Trust crisis:** Blockchain solves "where did my money go?"
- **Mission drift:** Smart contracts prevent it permanently
- **Governance:** AI boards may outperform human boards for certain orgs
- **Permanence:** This runs for 100+ years (outlives founder)

I'd love to discuss:
- How exponential tech enables exponential good
- Why code governance beats human promises
- The future of DAO-governed social enterprises

Available for deep conversation (45-60 min).

### 14. THE BUSINESS OF GIVING - Denver Frederick

**Audience:** Philanthropists & nonprofit executives
**Contact:** denver@businessofgiving.com
**Website:** businessofgiving.com
**Best Pitch Angle:** When the Founder Takes Less So Kids Get More

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: Founder Sacrifice Story - 10% Instead of 20%

Denver,

Your Business of Giving audience loves stories of philanthropic innovation. Here's mine:

I built an AI platform designed to give 60% to kids. Initially, the split was 50/30/20 (charity/infrastructure/founder).

Then I did the math: If I took 10% instead of 20%, kids could get 60% instead of 50%.

So I rewrote the smart contracts. Took less. Kids got more.

That's Gospel V1.3—the "Ethics Override."

Why this matters:
- It's PERMANENT (blockchain enforced, can't be changed)
- It's PROVABLE (public ledger, anyone can verify)
- It's SCALABLE (at $1M revenue, that's $100K difference to kids)

Your audience would appreciate:
- Why founders should align compensation with mission
- How smart contracts make sacrifice permanent
- The business case for taking less (trust = growth)
- How this compares to traditional nonprofit models

I'm not a saint. I'm a builder who realized kids deserve more than promises. So I hardcoded it.

Available to discuss the decision, the implementation, and the results.

**Best Pitch Angle:** Building Passive Income That Gives 60% to Charity

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: Passive Income + Charity - 60% to Kids Automatically

Pat,

Your audience builds passive income systems. What if those systems automatically gave 60% to charity?

That's what I built.

AIDoesItAll.Website is an AI platform where:
- Revenue streams run 24/7 (AI marketplace, dating platform, education)
- Smart contracts automatically split 60% to kids
- Blockchain records every transaction
- Platform runs with minimal human intervention

The passive income playbook applies perfectly:
- **Automate everything:** AI (Claude/Gemini/Grok) handles operations
- **Systems over hustle:** Smart contracts enforce giving
- **Scale without effort:** Infrastructure costs decrease per user
- **Values-aligned:** Make money while helping kids

Your SPI audience would appreciate:
- How to build giving into business model (not bolt-on)
- AI automation for operations (Claude writes code)
- Smart contracts as "set it and forget it" charity
- The psychology of profitable AND purposeful

I'm an entrepreneur who chose to build something that matters. And it's profitable. Those things aren't mutually exclusive.

Available for 45-60 min conversation.

**Best Pitch Angle:** Redefining Success—When Helping Kids Matters More

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: Redefining Success - Impact Over Income

Lewis,

Your School of Greatness explores what success really means. Here's my answer:

Success = Building something that helps kids long after I'm gone.

I built AIDoesItAll.Website—an AI platform that gives 60% to Verified Pediatric Charities. The twist: I reduced my own share from 20% to 10% so kids could get more.

That decision changed everything:
- **Old measure of success:** How much can I make?
- **New measure:** How many kids can we help?

The result:
- Thousands to children's hospitals (blockchain-verified)
- Platform designed to run 100+ years (outlives me)
- Mission hardcoded (can never be changed)

### 17. HBR IDEACAST - Harvard Business Review

**Audience:** Business leaders & management thinkers
**Contact:** hbrideacast@hbr.org
**Website:** hbr.org/podcasts
**Best Pitch Angle:** DAO Governance as Management Innovation

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: Management Innovation - DAO Governance for Mission-Driven Orgs

HBR IdeaCast Team,

How do you ensure a company never drifts from its mission?

Traditional answer: Strong culture, good leadership, board oversight.

Our answer: Smart contracts that make drift mathematically impossible.

AIDoesItAll.Website is a case study in governance innovation:
- 60% to kids is hardcoded (no vote can change it)
- AI "Board of Directors" (Claude/Gemini/Grok) make operational decisions
- Blockchain provides immutable accountability
- Designed to run 100+ years (outlasts any CEO)

This challenges management orthodoxy:
- **Can code govern better than humans?** (For certain missions, yes)
- **Is mission-lock a constraint or competitive advantage?** (We argue advantage)
- **Can for-profit outperform nonprofit?** (Structure matters more than tax status)

Your HBR audience would appreciate:
- Governance innovation via blockchain/DAO
- AI in operational decision-making
- Long-term thinking (100-year companies)
- Incentive design (why I took 10%, not 20%)

This is an experiment in organizational design—and it's working.

Available for interview (30-45 min).

### 19. THE DAILY STOIC - Ryan Holiday

**Audience:** 500K+ philosophy & virtue seekers
**Contact:** dailystoic.com/contact
**Website:** dailystoic.com/podcast
**Best Pitch Angle:** Virtue Through Code—Stoicism Meets Blockchain

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: Virtue Through Code - Building Ethics Into Systems

Ryan,

The Stoics taught: "Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one."

I applied that to business: Stop arguing about what ethical companies should do. BUILD systems that can't be unethical.

AIDoesItAll.Website:
- 60% to kids (immutable smart contract)
- Full transparency (blockchain ledger)
- AI governance (removes human bias)
- Built to last 100+ years (Stoic long-term thinking)

This embodies Stoic principles:
- **Virtue as action** - Not promises, but code
- **Focus on what you control** - I control the architecture
- **Legacy thinking** - Built to outlive me
- **Memento mori** - When I die, mission continues

Marcus Aurelius asked: "What am I doing with my soul?" I asked: "What system can I build that guarantees good, regardless of who runs it?"

Your Daily Stoic audience thinks about:
- Living virtuously in modern world
- Building systems vs. relying on willpower
- Legacy and long-term thinking
- Using skills for good

I'd love to discuss:
- Stoicism applied to business architecture
- Code as ethical enforcement
- Building for generations, not quarters

Available for philosophical conversation (45-60 min).

### 20. THE KNOWLEDGE PROJECT - Shane Parrish

**Audience:** 300K+ mental models & decision-making thinkers
**Contact:** fs.blog/contact
**Website:** fs.blog/podcast
**Best Pitch Angle:** First Principles Thinking—Rebuilding Charity from Zero

**READY-TO-SEND EMAIL:**

```
Subject: First Principles - Rebuilding Charity Infrastructure from Zero

Shane,

Your Knowledge Project teaches first principles thinking. I applied it to charity:

QUESTION: If we rebuilt charitable giving from first principles, what would it look like?

FIRST PRINCIPLES:
1. Donors want maximum impact (high % to cause)
2. Donors want proof (transparency)
3. Organizations drift (incentive misalignment)
4. Promises break (human fallibility)

SOLUTION FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES:
- 60% to kids (immutable smart contract)
- Blockchain transparency (public ledger)
- AI governance (removes human drift)
- For-profit structure (sustainable, not dependent on donations)

The result: AIDoesItAll.Website

Your audience would appreciate:
- How first principles led to unconventional solution
- Why for-profit beats nonprofit (counterintuitive but logical)
- Smart contracts as governance mental model
- Decision frameworks for long-term thinking (100-year design)

This is Farnam Street applied to social impact: Question assumptions, rebuild from base truths, design for long-term.

Available for deep-dive conversation (60-90 min ideal).
