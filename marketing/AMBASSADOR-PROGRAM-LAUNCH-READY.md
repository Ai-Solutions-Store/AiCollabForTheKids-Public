## ACTIVATION KIT FOR AMBASSADORS

### SOCIAL MEDIA TEMPLATES

**Twitter/X Thread Template:**
```
?? Why I'm an Ambassador for @ForTheKidsDAO:

1/ Most platforms talk about "giving back."
   FOR THE KIDS puts it in writing: 60% to verified pediatric charities.
   30% to infrastructure. 10% to founder.

2/ This isn't charity theater. It's Gospel V1.3 - an immutable smart
   contract on blockchain. The math doesn't lie.

3/ I've seen platforms promise impact. FOR THE KIDS proves it.
   Real-time treasury. Verified charities. Transparent distributions.

4/ Every share I make isn't marketing. It's fundraising.
   Every person who signs up = more money to kids who need it.

5/ If you care about pediatric healthcare, childhood education, or
   just basic human decency... check them out: [Link]

6/ 60% to kids. Always. No exceptions. That's the whole pitch.

#ForTheKids #PediatricCharity #ImpactFirst
```

**LinkedIn Post Template:**
```
I don't usually post about side projects, but this one matters.

I'm an Ambassador for FOR THE KIDS - a platform that directs 60% of
revenue to verified pediatric charities.

Not "up to 60%." Not "a portion." Exactly 60%. Every time. Coded into
smart contracts.

Why does this matter?
- Childhood cancer funding is chronically underfunded (4% of NCI budget)
- Pediatric hospitals face constant resource shortages
- Families go bankrupt paying for kids' medical care

FOR THE KIDS isn't solving everything. But 60% is a damn good start.

If your company has a CSR budget, employee giving program, or just
humans who care about kids - I'd love to connect you.

"60% of revenue to pediatric charities"

[Slide 2: Gospel V1.3 split graphic]
"Not a promise. A smart contract."

[Slide 3: Your face/story]
"I'm an Ambassador because..."

[Slide 4: Call to action]
"Link in bio. For the kids."

```

**Facebook Post Template:**
```
Friends, I need 2 minutes of your time.

I joined FOR THE KIDS as an Ambassador because of a simple promise:
60% of every dollar goes to verified pediatric charities.

Not someday. Not "a portion." 60%. Always.

I've worked in [healthcare/education/nonprofit] for X years. I've seen
platforms overpromise and underdeliver.

FOR THE KIDS is different:
? Smart contract enforcement (can't cheat the code)
? Verified charity partners (St. Jude, Children's Hospital, etc.)
? Real-time treasury tracking (see the money move)

If you:
- Have kids
- Work with kids
- Give a damn about kids

Check it out: [Link]

Every share = more funding for pediatric care.
Every signup = 60% to charities.

Simple as that.

### TALKING POINTS BY AUDIENCE

**To Parents:**
"As a parent, I wanted to support something that actually helps kids. FOR THE KIDS directs 60% of revenue to verified pediatric charities - places like St. Jude and Children's Hospital. It's not charity theater. It's coded into the platform."

**To Healthcare Workers:**
"You see the funding gaps every day. FOR THE KIDS puts 60% of revenue directly into pediatric care. Real money, real impact, real-time tracking. I'm an Ambassador because I'm tired of watching kids go without."

**To Nonprofit Professionals:**
"Finally, a platform that gets it. 60% to mission. 30% to infrastructure. 10% to founder. Gospel V1.3 is what ethical business looks like. I'm an Ambassador because this is the model I want to see everywhere."

**To Corporate Partners:**
"If your company has a CSR budget, FOR THE KIDS is the most transparent vehicle I've found. 60% goes to verified pediatric charities via smart contract. Your impact is trackable, verifiable, and meaningful. Happy to connect your team."

**To Faith Communities:**
"This is Matthew 25:40 in action. 60% of revenue goes to kids in need. The founder literally took a pay cut (from 20% to 10%) to give more to children. If that's not Gospel values, I don't know what is."

**To Veterans/First Responders:**
"Mission first. FOR THE KIDS operates like the best units I've served with - clear objective (60% to kids), transparent execution (smart contracts), zero tolerance for BS. I'm an Ambassador because this is how you run an operation."

## CRISIS MANAGEMENT

### AMBASSADOR CODE OF CONDUCT

**Expectations:**
1. **Gospel V1.3 Compliance:** Always cite 60/30/10 split correctly
2. **Factual Accuracy:** No exaggerated claims about impact
3. **Respectful Engagement:** No harassment, hate speech, or trolling
4. **Transparency:** Disclose Ambassador status when appropriate
5. **Mission-First:** Advocacy is about kids, not personal brand building

**Violations:**
- Warning (first offense, if minor)
- Suspension (second offense or major violation)
- Removal (third offense or egregious violation)

---

### SCENARIO PLAYBOOK

**Scenario 1: Ambassador Makes False Claim**
- Example: "FOR THE KIDS cures childhood cancer"
- Response: Private message ? request correction ? public clarification if needed
- Prevention: Clear talking points, pre-approved templates

**Scenario 2: Ambassador Engages in Controversy**
- Example: Political rant on personal account while displaying badge
- Response: Assess if badge display implies endorsement ? request removal from controversial posts
- Prevention: Code of Conduct clarity on personal vs. Ambassador content

**Scenario 3: Ambassador Requests Excessive Special Treatment**
- Example: "I want a 1:1 with the founder every week"
- Response: Redirect to tier benefits ? explain resource constraints ? offer group alternatives
- Prevention: Clear tier benefit documentation

**Scenario 4: Platform Fails to Meet 60% Promise (Hypothetical)**
- Response: Immediate transparency email to all Ambassadors ? explain what happened ? corrective action ? rebuild trust
- Prevention: Smart contract enforcement makes this nearly impossible

## BUDGET BREAKDOWN (Annual)

**Fixed Costs:**
- Program Manager salary/contractor: $40,000
- Content Coordinator (PT): $20,000
- Community Manager (PT): $15,000
- Software/tools: $7,200
- **Subtotal:** $82,200

**Variable Costs:**
- Swag/merchandise (500 packs @ $25): $12,500
- Event costs (virtual platform, prizes): $5,000
- Video production (4 spotlights): $8,000
- Ambassador rewards (top performers): $10,000
- Revenue share (estimated at scale): $25,000
- **Subtotal:** $60,500

**TOTAL ANNUAL BUDGET:** $142,700

**Funded From:** 30% infrastructure allocation (does NOT touch 60% charity commitment)

**ROI Calculation:**
- If Ambassadors refer 500 users @ $50/user average = $25,000 revenue
- 60% to charity: $15,000
- 30% to infrastructure: $7,500
- Covers ~5% of program cost, BUT:
  - Organic reach is priceless (millions in ad-equivalent value)
  - Community loyalty is priceless (retention multiplier)
  - Mission advocacy is the whole point (can't put a price on hearts won)

**This is an investment in movement building, not just marketing.**

## GOSPEL V1.3 COMPLIANCE CHECKPOINTS

**Every Ambassador Communication Must Include:**
- ? "60% to verified pediatric charities" (not 60%)
- ? "Gospel V1.3" or "60/30/10 split" (not V1.2 or 60/30/10)
- ? "Founder takes 10%" if mentioned (not 20%)

**Audit Process:**
- Program Manager reviews all templates monthly
- Ambassadors report any violations via #gospel-guardian Discord channel
- Bounty paid for verified compliance issues ($50 gift card)

**This is non-negotiable. Gospel V1.3 is the mission.**

---

## CONCLUSION

The FOR THE KIDS Ambassador Program is not a marketing gimmick. It's a movement.

We're recruiting humans who believe:
- Kids deserve 60% of the pie (not an afterthought)
- Transparency beats corporate BS
- Community impact > personal profit

Every Ambassador is a mission guardian. Every share is a fundraiser. Every referral is a child helped.

**This program scales impact exponentially:**
- 1 Ambassador ? 10 shares ? 100 people reached ? 5 signups ? $150 to charity
- 100 Ambassadors ? 1,000 shares ? 10,000 people reached ? 500 signups ? $15,000 to charity
- 1,000 Ambassadors ? 10,000 shares ? 100,000 people reached ? 5,000 signups ? $150,000 to charity

**The math is simple. The mission is clear.**

60% to kids. Always. No exceptions.

Let's build an army.
