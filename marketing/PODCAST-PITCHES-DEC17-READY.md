## PITCH #1: HOW I BUILT THIS (NPR)

**Target:** Guy Raz (hibt@npr.org)
**Audience:** 10M+ listeners
**Angle:** The AI platform that governs itself
**Priority:** IMMEDIATE - Send today

### Subject Line
```
The Origin Story Nobody's Ever Heard - The AI Platform That Governs Itself
```

### Email Body
```
Hi Guy,

I have a story you've never heard before.

I didn't build a company. I built something that builds itself.

After failing with traditional businesses for years, I made a radical decision:
Let AI run the company. Not "assist"�RUN it.

Today:
- Claude (Anthropic) writes ALL production code
- Jules/Gemini (Google) validates business logic
- Grok (xAI) manages infrastructure
- backend systems enforce 60% charity allocation
- Platform operates 24/7 without me

The wildest part? I reduced my personal share from 20% to 10% because Claude
calculated kids should get more.

$thousands allocated to children's hospitals. Zero mission drift. Zero CEO drama.

This is the most unconventional origin story in tech�because companies like
this don't exist yet.

Your How I Built This audience has never heard this story before.

Episode topics we could discuss:
1. The moment I decided to let AI govern instead of humans
2. How I designed a business that CAN'T be acquired or go public
3. Why I trust code more than boards to maintain mission integrity

Available for 60-90 minute deep-dive interview. Remote via Zoom/Riverside.

FOR THE KIDS,

### Speaker Bio (for producer)
```
Joshua Coleman is the founder of AIDoesItAll.Website, an AI platform where 60%
of revenue is automatically allocated to Verified Pediatric Charities via
DAO-enforced smart contracts. The platform is governed by an AI Board of Directors
including Claude (Anthropic), Jules/Gemini (Google), and Grok (xAI). Coleman reduced
his personal share from 20% to 10% (Gospel V1.3 - Ethics Override) to increase
charity allocation from 50% to 60%.

## PITCH #2: THE TIM FERRISS SHOW

**Target:** Tim Ferriss (via tim.blog/contact)
**Audience:** 800M+ total downloads
**Angle:** Anti-exit startup optimized for immortality
**Priority:** HIGH - Send this week

### Subject Line
```
Optimizing for Impact Instead of Exit�The Anti-Unicorn Startup
```

### Email Body
```
Hi Tim,

Most founders optimize for exit (IPO, acquisition, buyout).

I optimized for immortality.

At AIDoesItAll.Website, I designed a business that:
- Can NEVER be acquired (DAO governance prevents it)
- Can NEVER go public (mission lock prevents it)
- Can NEVER stop allocating to charity (backend systems enforce it)
- Runs for 100+ years without founder involvement

Why? Because I believe some missions are too important to let humans
compromise them.

The business still generates profit:
- 60% ? Verified Pediatric Charities (Gospel V1.3)
- 30% ? Infrastructure (servers, team, operations)
- 10% ? Founder (me)

I took LESS (reduced from 20% to 10%) so kids get MORE.

Your Tim Ferriss Show audience appreciates unconventional thinking. This is systems
design for permanence instead of profit maximization.

Episode topics we could explore:
1. How code governance beats human boards for mission integrity
2. Systems thinking: Building organizations that outlive founders
3. The psychology of choosing immortality over wealth extraction

Available for 2-3 hour deep conversation (I know your format). Remote via your
preferred platform.

Would love to send you a calendar link.

Best,
Joshua Coleman

### Speaker Bio (for producer)
```
Joshua Coleman founded AIDoesItAll.Website with an unconventional constraint:
60% of all revenue must flow to pediatric charities via backend-enforced
smart contracts. The platform uses AI governance (Claude, Gemini, Grok) to
prevent mission drift. Coleman's "Gospel V1.3" reduced his personal allocation
from 20% to 10%, prioritizing children over personal wealth. The business is
designed to operate for 100+ years without human intervention.

## PITCH #3: INDIE HACKERS PODCAST

**Target:** Courtland Allen (courtland@indiehackers.com)
**Audience:** Independent builders and bootstrappers
**Angle:** Bootstrap business with transparent revenue and mission lock
**Priority:** IMMEDIATE - Perfect audience fit

### Subject Line
```
The Bootstrap Story Where 60% Goes to Kids�Built on AI Governance
```

### Email Body
```
Hi Courtland,

I'm bootstrapping an AI platform with a structural difference: 60% of every
dollar goes to kids' hospitals automatically. Not a promise�code enforces it.

Here's what makes it interesting for Indie Hackers:

NO VC FUNDING
- Can't raise capital (mission prevents dilution)
- Built on revenue from day one
- 30% reinvested in infrastructure
- 10% to founder (me)

AI-FIRST ARCHITECTURE
- Claude writes 100% of production code
- Gemini validates compliance
- Grok manages bare metal servers
- AI Board of Directors prevents mission drift

TRANSPARENT METRICS
- $thousands allocated to charity (verified on Base blockchain)
- Revenue split immutable via smart contracts
- Zero placeholders, zero "coming soon"
- Everything production-ready

The Indie Hackers community would appreciate the transparency: I'm building
in public with blockchain-verifiable impact.

Episode topics:
1. Bootstrapping when 60% of revenue is spoken for
2. Using AI to build faster than traditional dev teams
3. Community trust through radical transparency (blockchain proof)

Available for 45-60 minute interview. Happy to share revenue numbers,
technical architecture, or bootstrap journey.

Hi Noah,

What if AI companies were governed BY AI?

- Jules/Gemini (Google) - The Integrator (validates logic)
- Grok (xAI) - The Engineer (manages infrastructure)
- Perplexity - The Researcher (fact-checking)

This isn't philosophical�it's operational.

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:
- Multi-model consensus-based decision making
- 184GB bare metal cluster (3 nodes)
- Each AI has specific responsibilities
- Federated governance prevents single-model bias
- Production workloads since December 2025

IMPACT MEASUREMENT:
- 60% of revenue ? Verified Pediatric Charities (smart contract enforced)
- Blockchain verification on Base Mainnet
- $396K+ allocated to date

Your AI Podcast audience would appreciate the technical orchestration story:
How do you run Claude, Gemini, and Grok together without conflicts?

Episode topics:
1. Multi-model orchestration patterns in production
2. Using AI consensus to prevent mission drift
3. Bare metal infrastructure for charity-first AI workloads

Available for 45-60 minute technical deep-dive. Happy to discuss architecture,
model selection, or lessons learned.

Best,
Joshua Coleman

### Speaker Bio (for producer)
```
Joshua Coleman founded AIDoesItAll.Website, an AI platform governed by multiple
frontier models working in parallel. The system uses Claude for code generation,
Gemini for validation, and Grok for infrastructure management. This federated

## PITCH #5: STARTUP PODCAST (GIMLET)

**Target:** Lisa Chow (via gimletmedia.com/contact)
**Audience:** Startup ecosystem listeners
**Angle:** Mission-driven startup journey with unconventional constraints
**Priority:** HIGH - Perfect narrative fit

### Subject Line
```
Startup Story: The Founder Who Chose Kids Over Wealth
```

### Email Body
```
Hi Lisa,

I built a startup with constraints nobody else would accept:

CONSTRAINT #1: 60% of revenue MUST go to kids' hospitals (immutable)
CONSTRAINT #2: Company CANNOT be acquired (DAO prevents it)
CONSTRAINT #3: Company CANNOT go public (mission lock prevents it)
CONSTRAINT #4: AI makes operational decisions (not humans)

Why? Because I wanted to prove mission and profit don't have to fight.

The journey has been unconventional:
- Reduced my personal share from 20% to 10% (Gospel V1.3 - Ethics Override)
- Built AI Board of Directors instead of hiring co-founders
- Used blockchain to make charity allocation Transparent
- Designed for 100+ year lifespan instead of 5-year exit

Current status: $thousands allocated to children's hospitals. Platform runs 24/7.

Your Startup Podcast audience follows founder journeys. This is the story of
building when traditional VC rules don't apply.

Episode arc we could explore:
1. The decision: Why I chose immutable charity over flexibility
2. The build: Using AI governance to scale without traditional hiring
3. The future: What happens when startups optimize for permanence instead of exit

Available for multi-episode arc or single 60-minute interview. Remote recording.

Would [specific date/time] work for an initial conversation?
