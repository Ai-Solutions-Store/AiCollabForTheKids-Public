## Post 2: Income Droid - Revenue Automation

**Headline:** Stop Leaving Money on the Table While You Sleep

**Body:**
Your business has revenue opportunities running 24/7. Your team doesn't.

Income Droid is revenue automation that works while you're not. It identifies, pursues, and closes opportunities across your entire customer lifecycle without human intervention.

**What it automates:**
- Follow-up sequences that convert abandoned carts and stalled deals
- Upsell identification and execution for existing customers
- Lead qualification and nurturing from first contact to sales-ready
- Revenue recovery from churned or inactive accounts

**The Numbers:**
Average client sees 23% revenue increase in first 90 days. Not from new traffic. From opportunities already in your system that were being missed.

$499 for automation that runs perpetually vs. hiring another sales rep at $60K+ annually.

**Real Example:**
SaaS company with 2,000 users deployed Income Droid to handle upgrade prompts and feature discovery. Added $47K MRR in 6 months without changing their product or pricing.

The revenue is already there. You just need systems that work as hard as you do.

## Post 3: Marketing Engine - Social Media Automation

**Headline:** Your Marketing Team Just Got 10x More Productive

**Body:**
Consistent social presence requires 15-20 hours per week of content creation, scheduling, and engagement.

- Platform-specific content generation (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)
- Optimal posting schedules based on your audience data
- Engagement monitoring and response suggestions
- Content performance analytics and strategy adjustment

**The Business Case:**
Social media manager salary: $50K-70K annually
Agency retainer: $2K-5K monthly
Marketing Engine: $199 one-time

You get enterprise-level social presence without enterprise-level overhead.

**Client Result:**
B2B consulting firm went from 2 posts per week to 5 posts per day across 3 platforms. Engagement up 340%. Inbound leads up 67%. Time spent: 2 hours per week vs. 15 previously.

Automation isn't about replacing creativity. It's about amplifying it.

## Post 5: Custom AI Development Services

**Headline:** Off-the-Shelf AI Isn't Built for Your Edge Cases

**Body:**
Generic AI tools solve generic problems. But your competitive advantage lives in the specific, complex workflows that are unique to your business.

That's where custom AI development creates asymmetric returns.

**When Custom Makes Sense:**
- You have proprietary processes that drive your business value
- Your industry has compliance or data requirements that generic tools can't meet
- You're integrating AI across legacy systems that weren't built for it
- Your use case has specific ROI requirements that demand optimization

**Our Approach:**
We don't build AI for the sake of AI. We build revenue-generating, cost-reducing, risk-mitigating systems that solve actual business problems.

**Process:**
1. Business outcome definition (not technical specs)
2. ROI modeling before we write a single line of code
3. Iterative deployment with measurement at each stage
4. Knowledge transfer so you own the system, not just rent it

**Recent Build:**
Manufacturing client needed AI quality inspection for custom parts (no existing model could handle it). We built, trained, and deployed a vision system that reduced defect escapes by 87% and cut inspection time by 60%. Paid for itself in 4 months.

**Investment Range:** Project-specific, but we structure everything around measurable payback periods.

If your business problem is worth solving, it's worth solving right.
