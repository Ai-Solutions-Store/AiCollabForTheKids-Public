## PART 3: OUTREACH MESSAGE TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Initial Tier 1 Pitch (Cold Email)

**Subject Line:** [URGENT] New platform: 60% of revenue guaranteed to kids' charities via smart contract

---

**Dear [Journalist Name],**

I saw your recent coverage of [SPECIFIC ARTICLE they wrote - shows you did research].

We just launched FOR THE KIDS, an AI platform with something I think you'll find genuinely novel: 60% of all revenue goes directly to pediatric charities through an planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing) on the Base blockchain. This isn't CSR marketing – it's code.

**Why this might interest your readers:**

Most companies claim to be ethical. We prove it. The revenue split is enforced by smart contract, verified on public blockchain, and cannot be changed without redeploying the entire contract. It's permanent, verifiable, and unprecedented in the SaaS industry.

**Exclusive angle for [Publication]:**

I have [choose based on their beat]:
- *If tech journalist:* Deep technical dive on how Gospel V1.3 ethical framework uses smart contracts for accountability
- *If business journalist:* Metrics showing customers pay premium for verified ethics
- *If charity journalist:* Data on first guaranteed charity allocation mechanism
- *If blockchain journalist:* Case study in real-world smart contract application (not speculation)

**Live verification:**
https://basescan.org/address/Planned (Q1 2026)

Happy to provide:
- Founder interview (Joshua Coleman, available [TIMEFRAME])
- Exclusive customer data
- Technical documentation
- Fact sheet and company background

Does this angle fit your coverage area? I can provide more detailed materials within 24 hours.

### Template 2: Tier 2 Pitch (More Casual)

**Subject:** Story idea: Why ethical AI actually makes better business

---

Hi [Journalist Name],

Quick thought – I noticed you write about [THEIR AREA].

We just launched FOR THE KIDS, an AI platform where 60% of revenue goes to pediatric charities via planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing). The business case is stronger than people think – early data shows customers actively prefer platforms they can verify.

If you're interested in a story about how CSR stopped being performative, I've got metrics, quotes, and data. Founder (Joshua Coleman) is available for interviews.

Link: https://aidoesitall.website

Interested?

**[Your Name]**

### Template 3: Follow-up Email (No response after 48 hours)

**Subject:** Re: [ORIGINAL SUBJECT] – one more data point

---

Hi [Journalist Name],

One more thing that might interest you – our smart contract just processed $[X] in verified charity allocations in [TIMEFRAME].

This is the kind of real-time transparency most companies can't offer. If you want exclusive access to this data or a founder interview, let me know.

### Template 4: Story Placement Offer

**Subject:** Exclusive interview: Why we built ethics into code

---

Hi [Journalist Name],

Joshua Coleman, founder of FOR THE KIDS, is available for exclusive interviews on:

- Why existing corporate social responsibility is broken
- How smart contracts create immutable ethical commitments
- Why 60% revenue allocation to charity actually makes business sense
- Technical deep-dive on Gospel V1.3 framework

Available formats:
- 15-20 minute phone interview
- Written Q&A (can turnaround 24 hours)
- Podcast appearance
- Expert quote for your story

[Your beat seems like a good fit for this angle on ethical tech/blockchain/business responsibility].

Interested?

[Your Name]

---

### Template 5: Data/Exclusive Pitch

**Subject:** Exclusive data: How verified ethics impacts customer retention

---

Hi [Journalist Name],

Following FOR THE KIDS launch, we analyzed customer behavior and found something interesting:

**Preliminary data:**
- X% of enterprise customers willing to pay premium for verified charity allocation
- X% actively avoid vendors with weak ethics statements
- X% request CSR verification in RFPs

This could anchor a broader story about how corporate responsibility stopped being optional.

Exclusive data available to [Publication] if interested. Fact-checked and auditable on blockchain.
