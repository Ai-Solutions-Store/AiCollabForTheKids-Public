Subject: Founder Story: Why I Took 10% Instead of 20%

Editors,

Most "ethical" founders take 20-30% of their company. Joshua reduced his from 20% to 10% to help more kids.

This article tells the story behind the 60/30/10 split, why founder ego
matters less than kids' health, and how we built a sustainable model
that proves you can do more good AND build a real business.

The data:
- $building towards impact allocated in year one
- goal: help thousands of children
- 60% to verified pediatric charities (hardcoded in smart contract)
- 30% infrastructure (essential for scaling)
- 10% founder (sustainable salary, not ego)

This is a story about redefining success for impact entrepreneurs.

## TOOLS FOR BACKLINK MANAGEMENT

**Essential (Monthly Cost):**
- Ahrefs ($99/mo) - Best for monitoring + research
- Semrush ($120/mo) - Alternative/supplement
- Google Search Console (Free) - Official data

**Optional (One-Time or Free):**

## COMMON BACKLINK MISTAKES (AVOID)

- ❌ Pursuing low-quality links (guest post networks, link exchanges)
- ❌ Unnatural anchor text ("click here" is fine; "social enterprise" anchor on unrelated site is not)
- ❌ Rapid spike in links (looks like purchased links to Google)
- ❌ Not diversifying link sources (60% from one domain = suspicious)
- ❌ Ignoring domain authority (1 link from DA 90 > 10 links from DA 30)
- ❌ No outreach follow-up (pitch once, give up)
- ❌ Generic pitches (copy-paste templates detected)
- ❌ Not tracking links (fly blind, don't know what's working)

---
