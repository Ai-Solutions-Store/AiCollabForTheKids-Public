## SIGN-OFF

**Document Prepared By:** Claude (Opus 4.5)
**Reviewed By:** Joshua Coleman (Founder)
**Date:** December 17, 2025
**Status:** ACTIONABLE CHECKLIST READY
**Gospel Version:** V1.3 (60/30/10)

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Media assets are the #1 blocker to launch. Without thumbnail + gallery images, Product Hunt launch cannot proceed.

**RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP:** Begin asset creation immediately. Allocate 17-23 hours for required assets. Consider hiring professional designer if timeline is tight.

**FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS.**

---

**This checklist is your complete roadmap. Every item marked with ? must become ? before launch. Start with thumbnail and top 3 gallery images. Build momentum. Launch excellence.**
