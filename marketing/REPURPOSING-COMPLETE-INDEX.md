## COMMON QUESTIONS ANSWERED

**Q: Do I have to do all 4 formats?**
A: No. Start with blog + Twitter thread. Add video when comfortable. You can do just 2 formats and still see massive results.

**Q: How much does this cost?**
A: Free if you use only free tools. $18/month for professional tier (Canva Pro + Buffer). $130+/month for full suite.

**Q: Can I do this with a team?**
A: Yes. The workflow document has a team section. Ideal: Writer (6h) + Designer (4h) + Video Editor (4h) + Social Manager (3h).

**Q: How long before I see results?**
A: Week 1 is all setup. By week 3 you'll see traffic/engagement. By week 8 you'll see significant growth.

**Q: What if I can only do 10 hours/week?**
A: The "Time Optimization" section in WEEKLY-WORKFLOW covers this. You can do bi-weekly cycles instead of weekly.

**Q: Do I have to use your templates?**
A: No. They're starting points. Adapt them to your voice/style. Better to customize than force something that doesn't feel authentic.

**Q: How do I measure success?**
A: Use the KPIs in TRANSFORMATION-MATRIX + the analytics Friday section in WEEKLY-WORKFLOW. Track: traffic, engagement, email growth, follower growth.

**Q: Can I automate this?**
A: Scheduling is mostly automated (Buffer, ConvertKit). Content creation can't be automated (yet). But the workflow makes it efficient.

**Q: What if a format doesn't work for me?**
A: Try it for 4 weeks first. Then if it's not resonating, swap it out for a different format. Some audiences prefer video, some prefer email.
