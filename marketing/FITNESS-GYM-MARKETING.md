- **Mitigation:** Lead with brand value, not just revenue (loyalty, attraction)
- **Backup:** Offer fixed sponsorship option ($5K-$10K/location) with optional profit-share
- **Timeline:** Pilot with 2-3 regional chains before national rollout

### Risk: Supplement Market Saturation
- **Mitigation:** Focus on unique positioning ("Charity Supplement") and bundling
- **Backup:** Partner with established brand rather than private label
- **Timeline:** Test 2 products before full portfolio launch

### Risk: Fitness Challenge Low Enrollment
- **Mitigation:** Free tier offering (basic workouts, community only)
- **Backup:** Corporate wellness partnerships (B2B)
- **Timeline:** Soft launch with influencer referrals to build social proof

### Risk: App Partnership Complexity
- **Mitigation:** Start with simple integration (contribution button) before deep API work
- **Backup:** Build standalone FOR THE KIDS fitness app (18-month timeline)
- **Timeline:** MVP by month 6, full integration by month 12
