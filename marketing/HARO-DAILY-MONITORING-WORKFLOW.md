# HARO DAILY MONITORING WORKFLOW
## Real-Time Query Response System & Tracking
**Gospel V1.3 Optimized - 60/30/10 Split**

---

## WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

This workflow is designed to maximize response rate while maintaining quality.
Best results require consistent execution: **90 minutes daily + 30 min lunch check + 15 min evening review**.

**Total Weekly Time:** 12 hours = ~$50,000 earned media value
**ROI:** 4,000:1 minimum

## PART 1: DAILY RHYTHM

### MORNING ROUTINE (6:30 AM - 8:00 AM EST)

**Duration:** 90 minutes
**Goal:** Respond to 3-5 queries before most competitors wake up
**Success Rate:** 35% publication rate (peak timing)

#### Step 1: Email Check & Batch Reading (6:30 - 6:45 AM)

```
☐ Check email for HARO queries (batch from 5:00-6:30 AM)
☐ Mark emails as unread for tracking
☐ Scan subject lines (takes 2 minutes)
☐ Count total queries received
☐ Note any urgent/time-sensitive queries
```

**What to look for in subject lines:**
- High fit to our 5 core categories (see below)
- Clear journalist name and publication (or "unknown")
- Specific vs. generic query (specific = better fit)
- Timeframe (most have 24-hour deadline from 5 PM yesterday)

#### Step 2: Rapid Priority Scoring (6:45 - 6:55 AM)

**Score each query 1-12 using this rubric:**

| Factor | Points | Scoring Guidance |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Alignment** | 0-5 | Does it fit our core mission/story? |
| **Audience** | 0-3 | Publication size/quality (3=major outlet) |
| **Timing** | 0-2 | Early responder advantage (2=first 2 hours) |
| **Effort** | 0-2 | Can use template directly? (2=yes, 0=custom) |
| **TOTAL** | **0-12** | **Score** |

**Scoring reference:**

- **Alignment scoring (0-5):**
  - 5 = Perfect fit (blockchain + charity, AI governance, founder story)
  - 4 = Strong fit (social impact, healthcare, ethics)
  - 3 = Decent fit (parenting, business, entrepreneurship)
  - 2 = Weak fit (can adapt template but not ideal)
  - 1 = Very weak fit (barely applicable)
  - 0 = No fit (skip entirely)

- **Audience scoring (0-3):**
  - 3 = Major outlet (Forbes, NYT, TechCrunch, NPR, Fast Company, etc.)
  - 2 = Vertical publication (MIT Sloan, VentureBeat, Healthcare IT, etc.)
  - 1 = Online blog/small publication (Medium, Substack, niche site)
  - 0 = Unknown/very small

- **Timing scoring (0-2):**
  - 2 = First 2 hours (huge advantage: 35% publication rate)
  - 1 = 2-6 hours (good: 25% publication rate)
  - 0 = 6+ hours (declining: 20% publication rate)

- **Effort scoring (0-2):**
  - 2 = Use template directly (5 min response time)
  - 1 = Minimal customization needed (8 min response time)
  - 0 = Needs custom response (15+ min response time)

**Example Scoring:**

```
Query: "DAO governance in tech companies"
- Alignment: 5 (perfect - our core story)
- Audience: 2 (tech newsletter, good reach)
- Timing: 2 (early morning, first batch)
- Effort: 2 (Template B fits perfectly)
TOTAL: 11/12 ← RESPOND IMMEDIATELY

Query: "Is AI good or bad?"
- Alignment: 3 (tangential - can fit ethics angle)
- Audience: 1 (small online publication)
- Timing: 1 (mid-morning query)
- Effort: 0 (needs custom response)
TOTAL: 5/12 ← SKIP (save time for better queries)
```

#### Step 3: Response Queue Prioritization (6:55 - 7:00 AM)

Create response queue:

```
IMMEDIATE (Score 10-12): Respond now
- Blockchain query from TechCrunch reporter
- AI governance query from major tech outlet
- Founder story query from business publication

NEXT (Score 8-9): Respond within 2 hours
- Healthcare tech query
- Social impact query

LATER (Score 6-7): Respond if time
- Business/entrepreneurship query

SKIP (Score 0-5): Don't respond
- Generic queries that don't fit story
```

#### Step 4: Response Creation (7:00 - 7:50 AM)

**For each IMMEDIATE query (10-12 score):**

1. **Copy template** (30 seconds)
   - Find best matching template from HARO-RESPONSE-TEMPLATES-BY-TOPIC.md
   - Copy to new email draft

2. **Customize** (2-3 minutes per response)
   - Insert journalist name (make it personal)
   - Reference their specific query/angle
   - Keep core story (Gospel V1.3, smart contracts)
   - Update current numbers if needed (see monthly refresh below)

3. **Quick proofread** (1 minute per response)
   - Check for typos
   - Ensure Gospel V1.3 compliance (60%, not 60%)
   - Verify contact info current
   - Confirm signature format

4. **Send** (30 seconds per response)
   - IMPORTANT: Send before 7:30 AM if possible
   - This puts you in top 2-hour window
   - Before journalists start filtering responses

**Time calculation:**
- Template 1: 3 min (copy + customize + send)
- Template 2: 3 min
- Template 3: 3 min
- Template 4: 3 min
- Template 5: 3 min
- **Total:** 15 minutes for 5 responses

#### Step 5: Response Tracking (7:50 - 8:00 AM)

For each response sent:

```
☐ Add to Google Sheet tracker with:
  - Date sent
  - Query title
  - Journalist name
  - Publication (if known)
  - Template used
  - Time sent
  - Status: "Pending"
  - Expected publication date (usually 2-4 weeks)
```

**Tracking spreadsheet columns:**
Date Sent | Query Title | Category | Journalist | Publication | Template Used | Time Sent | Status | Quote Used? | URL | Traffic | Notes

---

### MIDDAY CHECK (11:30 AM - 12:00 PM EST)

**Duration:** 30 minutes
**Goal:** Respond to any missed high-fit queries from morning batch + respond to new queries

#### Step 1: Query Refresh (11:30 - 11:40 AM)

```
☐ Check email for NEW queries (from 8 AM - 11:30 AM batch)
☐ Quick score (same rubric as morning)
☐ Identify any 10+ score queries
☐ Respond to those immediately
```

#### Step 2: Secondary Responses (11:40 AM - 12:00 PM)

```
☐ Review "NEXT" priority queue from morning (8-9 scores)
☐ If time, respond to 1-2 of those
☐ If no high-fit queries, review previous afternoon responses
☐ Keep one eye on response clock (some queries close by 5 PM)
```

---

### EVENING REVIEW (5:00 PM - 5:15 PM EST)

**Duration:** 15 minutes
**Goal:** Final check + plan next day + capture insights

#### Step 1: Final Query Check (5:00 - 5:05 PM)

```
☐ Check for last remaining open queries (deadline 5 PM next day)
☐ Only respond if PERFECT fit (10+ score minimum)
☐ Don't waste responses on marginal queries at end of cycle
```

#### Step 2: Daily Summary (5:05 - 5:10 PM)

```
☐ Count responses sent today
☐ Note which templates worked best
☐ Record any feedback from journalists
☐ Update daily log
```

#### Step 3: Next Day Planning (5:10 - 5:15 PM)

```
☐ Review tomorrow's expected volume
☐ Check if any queries are especially high-value
☐ Mentally prepare for morning responses
☐ Update tracker with any new information
```

---

## PART 7: FAILURE MODES & FIXES

### Problem: Not responding fast enough

**Symptom:** Response sent after 8:00 AM, publication rate below 15%

**Fix:**
- Set alarm for 6:15 AM (not 6:30 AM)
- Pre-save templates locally (don't wait to download)
- Pre-write generic customizations for top 3 categories
- Aim to send first response by 6:45 AM

### Problem: Spending too much time on low-fit queries

**Symptom:** Responding to 7+ queries daily, low publication rate

**Fix:**
- Be ruthless about 10+ minimum threshold
- Skip anything scoring below 6
- Save 5 hours for real work instead of 10 responses
- Quality over quantity

### Problem: Not tracking follow-ups properly

**Symptom:** Article publishes, you miss it (no Google Alert set up)

**Fix:**
- Set up Google Alerts immediately
- Check tracker weekly for status updates
- Manually Google your name + AIDoesItAll monthly
- Archive published articles immediately

### Problem: Templates feel stale/repetitive

**Symptom:** Lower response rate month-over-month

**Fix:**
- Refresh data monthly (allocation numbers, growth %, milestones)
- Test new angles quarterly (ask journalists what they want)
- Vary lead sentence for each response
- Read recent articles journalists published (customize better)

---

## PART 8: QUARTERLY STRATEGY REVIEW

Every 3 months, sit down and assess:

### Metrics Review

```
1. Publication rate trend (up/down/flat?)
2. Best performing categories (double down)
3. Worst performing categories (skip or improve)
4. Best performing templates (rank them)
5. Traffic value from articles (ROI calculation)
6. Journalist relationships (how many Tier 1?)
```

### Strategic Decisions

```
1. Keep spending most time on: [Category/Template]
2. Reduce time on: [Category/Template]
3. New category to test: [Category]
4. New template to build: [Angle]
5. Journalist relationships to strengthen: [Names]
```

### Goals for Next Quarter

```
1. Send [#] responses (prev quarter: [#])
2. Achieve [#]% publication rate (prev quarter: [#]%)
3. Get [#] major publication quotes (prev quarter: [#])
4. Reach [#] people (prev quarter: [#])
5. Add [#] Tier 1 journalists (prev quarter: [#])
```
