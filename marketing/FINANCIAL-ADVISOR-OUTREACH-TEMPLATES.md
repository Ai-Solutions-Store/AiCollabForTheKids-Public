## SECTION 1: EMAIL OUTREACH TEMPLATES

### EMAIL 1: INITIAL ADVISOR OUTREACH (CFP/Wealth Manager)

**Subject:** "Your Clients' Portfolios Just Helped 847 Children — Here's How"

**Body:**

```
Hi [Advisor Name],

I wanted to reach out because of something remarkable we're seeing
in the wealth management space.

When financial advisors integrate FOR THE KIDS into their practice,
something unexpected happens: clients don't just build wealth anymore.
They help children while doing it.

Here's what we've built:

When your clients make financial decisions through FOR THE KIDS:
? 60% of transaction revenue flows directly to verified pediatric charities
? 30% funds platform operations and innovation
? 10% sustains the mission

This isn't charity. This is structural profit allocation.

Real example from our current partners:
Last quarter, one advisor's 127 client transactions allocated $23,450
directly to children's healthcare. Their clients didn't contribute a dime.
They just invested normally through our platform.

Why is this powerful?

1. **Client Retention:** HNW clients are increasingly mission-driven.
   Showing them their wealth supports child wellness? That's a retention lever.

2. **Competitive Differentiation:** Every other advisor talks about returns.
   You show clients they're helping kids. That's a story clients tell their friends.

3. **Zero Extra Work:** The platform handles all allocation tracking, reporting,
   compliance, everything. You just share the referral link.

4. **Additional Revenue:** The 30% platform operations allocation includes
   advisor commission opportunity. Typically 5-15% of referral revenue.

What would it look like in your practice?

Imagine telling your HNW clients:
"Your portfolio grows. 60% of our platform revenue supports verified
pediatric hospitals. Your financial plan literally saves kids' lives."

That's the conversation happening right now with our current advisor partners.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if FOR THE KIDS makes sense
for your practice? No pressure, no obligation. Just a conversation about
whether impact allocation could differentiate your advisory business.

### EMAIL 2: COMPLIANCE-FOCUSED ADVISOR (with SEC/FINRA details)

**Subject:** "SEC-Compliant Profit Allocation for Your Advisory Practice"

**Body:**

```
Hi [Advisor Name],

I know you're careful about compliance (as you should be).

One question we get: "Is offering FOR THE KIDS to clients SEC-compliant?"

Short answer: Yes. And we've built it to be.

Here's why:

FOR THE KIDS isn't a separate investment product or charitable solicitation.
It's a **profit allocation structure embedded in your normal business operations**.

In SEC terms:
- Allocation is part of your advisory fee structure (disclosed in Form ADV)
- Clients pay the same amount (no hidden fees)
- The charitable portion comes from platform revenue, not client assets
- All allocation is transparent and auditable

What you need to know:
? Form ADV updates: We provide templates for required disclosures
? FINRA Rule 5210: All advisor marketing materials reviewed by compliance
? Client communication: Pre-approved messaging templates
? Audit trail: Every allocation blockchain-verified for SEC examination

We work with a compliance officer specifically for advisor partnerships.
She handles all the regulatory heavy lifting.

Many of our top-performing advisors come from firms with strict compliance
requirements. They like that everything is documented and auditable.

Would it make sense to have a brief call with our compliance team?
They can walk through the specific regulatory framework and address any
concerns your compliance officer might have.

You can reply to this email or calendar a time here:

### EMAIL 3: DAF/ESTATE PLANNING ADVISOR

**Subject:** "Tax-Efficient Charitable Allocation Strategy for Your HNW Clients"

**Body:**

```
Hi [Advisor Name],

Quick question: How many of your HNW clients ask about tax-efficient
charitable giving strategies?

If the answer is "most of them," you'll want to know about what we're
doing with FOR THE KIDS.

Scenario: Your client has $5M in appreciated securities.

Traditional approach:
- They contribute to a DAF (Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard)
- Immediate tax deduction on contribution
- They eventually recommend allocations from the DAF
- Result: Tax-efficient giving. Good.

FOR THE KIDS approach:
- Client creates DAF (same as above) + funds with appreciated securities
- Client recommends allocation to FOR THE KIDS directly from their DAF account
- FOR THE KIDS automatically allocates 60% of their contribution to
  verified pediatric charities
- Client gets full tax deduction + measurable impact outcomes
- Result: Tax-efficient giving + immediate, transparent impact.

The upgrade?

We handle all the allocation complexity. Your client doesn't have to
manually decide where their DAF dollars go every year. They set it once
and 60% automatically flows to child welfare.

For advisory practices, this is a conversation-starter:

"I've been recommending DAFs to HNW clients for years. Recently,
I discovered a vehicle that makes DAF allocations even more impactful
and transparent. Can I show you?"

Suddenly, your DAF conversation moves from "tax efficiency" to
"tax efficiency + measurable social impact."

Current DAF partners we're working with:
- Schwab Charitable
- Fidelity Charitable
- Vanguard Charitable

Your clients can implement this in 15 minutes through their existing DAF.

Worth a conversation?

### EMAIL 4: YOUNG/MILLENNIAL ADVISOR (Values-Driven)

**Subject:** "Why Your Younger Clients Care About This (And Why You Should Too)"

**Body:**

```
Hi [Advisor Name],

Real talk: You know why younger clients leave wealth advisors?

It's not usually because of returns. It's because they don't see their advisor
giving a damn about anything except fees.

If you're building a practice that serves millennial/Gen-Z clients,
you probably already get this. Values matter. A lot.

FOR THE KIDS is built for exactly this.

Your younger clients say things like:
"I want my wealth to do good."
"How is my money making a difference?"
"I don't just want returns. I want impact."

Most advisors have no answer except "we have an ESG option."

With FOR THE KIDS, you have a real answer:

"Every dollar allocated through our platform automatically directs 60%
to verified pediatric charities. Your wealth doesn't just grow.
It saves kids' lives. Measured. Verified. Transparent."

Younger clients *love* this. It's not charity-washing. It's profit
allocation built into the business model.

Real numbers from our current partners:
- Average retention improvement: +15-20% among under-40 clients
- Net new client acquisition: ESG/impact becomes a marketing differentiator
- Practice culture: Staff feels good about the firm's values

Think about what this does for your practice narrative:

From: "We manage money."
To: "We grow wealth that serves children. Measurably."

That second story? That's the story younger clients tell their friends.

Any interest in exploring this for your practice?

Best,
[Your Name]

### EMAIL 5: FOLLOW-UP (PERSISTENCE - 2 WEEKS LATER)

**Subject:** "Quick follow-up: Pro Bono CFP Program opportunity"

**Body:**

```
Hi [Advisor Name],

I know my last email might have gotten buried. No worries.

I wanted to flag something that's been resonating strongly with CFP
professionals specifically:

**The "Plan with Purpose" Pro Bono Program**

Here's the idea: You're already good at financial planning. What if you
could offer pro bono planning to families with children through a platform
that automatically allocates revenue to child welfare?

Benefits:
? Earn CE credits (pro bono service counts as continuing education)
? Build your personal brand ("I serve families for free + help kids too")
? Clients feel amazing (they got great planning at no cost)
? Impact metrics for your practice ("This year, I helped 47 families AND
  allocated $8,734 to pediatric charities")

No pressure on this. Just wanted to make sure you saw it because it's been
the fastest-growing program for CFP partners.

Quick question: Is 15 minutes worth a conversation about how this might work
for your practice?

Best,
[Your Name]

## SECTION 2: LINKEDIN MESSAGE TEMPLATES

### LINKEDIN TEMPLATE 1: Initial Connection + Message

**Connection Request:**
```
Hi [Name] — I work with financial advisors on profit allocation
strategies for their HNW clients. Thought we should connect.
```

**Follow-up message (after they accept):**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for connecting.

I saw your background in wealth management + noticed you've been posting
about ESG/impact investing. That's exactly why I'm reaching out.

We've built a platform where advisors can offer clients direct impact:
60% of every transaction automatically allocates to verified pediatric charities.

It's been resonating with advisors who want to differentiate beyond returns.
Curious if it's something you'd explore?

[Link to one-page overview]

Happy to chat if it's interesting.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

---

### LINKEDIN TEMPLATE 2: Thought Leadership Engagement

**Step 1:** Find a LinkedIn post by the advisor about ESG/wealth management/client values

**Comment on their post:**
```
Great insight on ESG integration [Advisor Name].

One thing we're seeing: advisors who move beyond ESG scores to direct
charitable impact see better client retention.

We've built a structure where 60% of platform revenue automatically flows
to verified pediatric charities. Clients actually see the impact
(not just an ESG score).

Would love to get your thoughts on the model.
```

**If they engage, send a DM:**
```
[Name], thanks for engaging with that comment.

Given your focus on ESG/impact, I think you'd find what we're doing
relevant. Are you open to a quick call about how advisors are using
profit allocation to differentiate?

No pressure if not the right time. Just wanted to surface it.
```

---

### LINKEDIN TEMPLATE 3: Value-First Content Strategy

**Post on your own LinkedIn (as founder/advisor):**
```
Most financial advisors compete on returns.

The ones winning with HNW clients? They're competing on purpose.

A client I spoke with yesterday said: "My last advisor made me money.
My current advisor makes me money AND shows me my wealth is helping kids."

That second advisor has a client for life.

FOR THE KIDS is how we've built that for advisors. Automatic allocation,
transparent tracking, real impact.

What's your experience? Do your clients care more about returns or purpose?
```

**Then engage with comments and DM people who engage thoughtfully.**

---

## SECTION 3: DIRECT PHONE/DISCOVERY CALL SCRIPTS

### DISCOVERY CALL SCRIPT (15 minutes)

**Opening (2 min):**
```
Hi [Advisor Name], thanks for making time.

Quick context: I work with wealth advisors on a profit allocation model
that's been getting traction with HNW clients. Thought you might find it
interesting, but I want to make sure it's relevant to your practice first.

Quick question: Are you currently doing anything around charitable impact
for your clients? ESG integration, supporter-advised fund recommendations, that kind of thing?
```

**Listen to their answer (1 min)**

**Positioning:**
```
Got it. So you're already thinking about impact. That's good.

What we're seeing is that a lot of advisors end there. They offer ESG funds
or DAF recommendations. But clients are asking for something faster and more
transparent.

Have you ever had a client ask: "Show me exactly how my wealth is helping people?"

Because that's where FOR THE KIDS comes in.
```

**The Pitch (5 min):**
```
Here's the simple version:

We built a platform where advisors can offer clients direct charitable
allocation. When clients use services through our platform:
- 60% of revenue goes directly to verified pediatric charities
- 30% funds platform operations
- 10% sustains the mission

From a client perspective: They invest through us normally. They see a
real-time dashboard: "My transactions have helped 47 children."

From your perspective: You have a new conversation starter with HNW clients
about impact. And there's commission opportunity in the platform.

What makes this different from traditional ESG?
- Real-time allocation (not annual reporting)
- Blockchain verification (full transparency)
- Specific outcomes (not ESG scores)
- Direct allocation (no fund fees)

Does that model resonate with how you think about client impact?
```

**Addressing Concerns (3 min):**

*If they say "Seems complicated"*
```
Actually, it's really simple on your end. You just share a referral link.
Platform handles everything else. All compliance, all tracking, all reporting.
```

*If they say "Is this SEC-compliant?"*
```
Yes, completely. Allocation is embedded in the advisory fee structure,
disclosed in Form ADV, and fully auditable. We provide all the templates.
No compliance red flags.
```

*If they say "My clients aren't interested in charity"*
```
That's interesting. In our experience, HNW clients care *a lot* about impact.
They just don't always know how to demonstrate it. When they see transparent,
measurable results, it becomes a differentiator for the advisor.

You might try asking your next 10 clients: "If your investment returns
also funded child welfare, would that interest you?" My bet is the response
surprises you.
```

**Close (2 min):**
```
Here's what I suggest:

First step is super simple. We can set you up with a test account.
You'll see the dashboard, how the tracking works, everything.

Then you can decide if you want to offer it to clients.

No pressure. Just a look under the hood.

Does that make sense? Can we get you set up?
```

Yeah, we hear that a lot. So we built something for exactly that.

FOR THE KIDS is a platform where advisors can offer clients direct impact.

## SECTION 5: SPECIAL USE CASE TEMPLATES

### ADVISOR HANDOFF AFTER FIRM MERGER/TRANSITION

**Email Template for Advisors Leaving Large Firms:**

```
Subject: Building Your Independent Practice? Try FOR THE KIDS

Hi [Advisor Name],

Congratulations on starting your own shop / joining [New Firm].

One thing we're seeing: Advisors building independent practices want
to differentiate fast. They can't out-fee the big firms. But they can
out-purpose them.

FOR THE KIDS gives you that narrative:
"I manage money like the big firms. But I also offer something they don't:
direct impact allocation. Your wealth doesn't just grow. It helps kids."

Current advisors report:
- Client acquisition: 20-30% faster with impact story
- Client retention: 18% higher among under-45 clients
- Practice culture: Staff feels better about the firm's values

New practice building phase is the perfect time to offer this.

Want to explore it?

Best,
[Your Name]
FOR THE KIDS
```

### ADVISOR-TO-ADVISOR REFERRAL

**Email from existing advisor partner to prospective advisor:**

```
Subject: You should check out FOR THE KIDS

Hi [Prospect],

[Existing Partner] recommended I connect with you about FOR THE KIDS.

I've been using it for 6 months. It's been one of the better decisions
I've made for practice differentiation. My HNW clients love it.

Here's what I like:
1. Clients ask about impact more. Having a concrete answer changes conversations.
2. Zero work on my end. Platform handles all the tracking.
3. Commission revenue. I averaged $3,200/month last quarter.
4. Retention. My under-40 clients especially appreciate the values alignment.

Might be worth 15 minutes for you to see what [Existing Partner] and I are seeing.

Happy to be a reference if helpful.

Best,
[Existing Advisor]
```

---

## SECTION 6: CRISIS/PIVOT MESSAGING

### IF PROSPECT SAYS "I ALREADY HAVE AN ESG SOLUTION"

```
That makes sense. Most advisors do.

The question is: How fast does your ESG solution deliver impact results?

Traditional ESG funds have 12-24 month reporting cycles. Clients fund
it today, find out about impact next year.

FOR THE KIDS is real-time. Client sees impact within weeks. That's a
different experience.

Plus, you can layer this *alongside* your existing ESG solution. They're
not competitive. One is strategic allocation, one is direct impact.

Does that distinction make sense?
```

---

### IF PROSPECT SAYS "SEEMS LIKE OVERHEAD"

```
I get that concern. Here's why it's actually simpler:

You don't manage anything. Platform handles all allocation, tracking,
compliance, and reporting. Your job is one thing: Share the referral
link with clients interested in impact.

The compliance framework? Completely built. Form ADV language? Templated.
Client reporting? Automated.

You just share the link. Everything else is automated.

Does that change how you think about it?
```

---

### IF PROSPECT SAYS "COMPLIANCE CONCERNS"

```
Fair question, and I respect that you're asking.

We've built this specifically for advisor compliance teams. Every allocation
is:
- SEC-compliant (disclosed in Form ADV as profit allocation, not advisory service)
- FINRA-compliant (pre-reviewed advisor marketing materials)
- Blockchain-audited (every dollar traceable for SEC examination)

We actually have a compliance officer who works specifically with advisor
partnerships. Happy to get her on a call with your compliance team.

Would that be helpful?
```
