Are you paying for ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, and Gemini Advanced separately? What if one platform could give you all three—working together?

Welcome to ForTheKids. We've built the first multi-AI collaboration platform where Claude Opus 4.5, ChatGPT, and Gemini analyze your projects together, debate solutions, and deliver better results than any single AI alone.

Here's how it works: You ask a question. Claude provides deep analysis. ChatGPT adds creative solutions. Gemini verifies with research. You get the best of all three—in one conversation.

But here's what makes us different: 60% of every subscription goes directly to verified pediatric charities. Not a one-time donation. Not a percentage of profits. 60% of revenue. Every month. Forever.

This is Gospel V1.3—our ethics-first model. You get enterprise-grade AI collaboration. Kids in hospitals get life-changing care. Everybody wins.

Thousands of developers, creators, and businesses already trust ForTheKids. Join them. Start your free trial today at ForTheKids.fund
