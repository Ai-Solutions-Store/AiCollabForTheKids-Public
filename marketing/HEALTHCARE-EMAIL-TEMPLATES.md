You're a pediatric nurse. You spend your days caring for children who need you most.

We built FOR THE KIDS for people like you.

## SECTION 5: NURTURE SEQUENCES

### Template 5A: 5-Email Healthcare Professional Nurture Sequence

**Email 1 (Day 1) - The Hook**
**Subject:** Healthcare Workers: The Problem We're Solving

Dear [Healthcare Professional],

You probably don't think much about WHERE your technology subscription money goes.

Most healthcare professionals don't. And most healthcare companies LIKE that.

We're different.

FOR THE KIDS is built with a single premise: **When healthcare professionals invest in technology, 60% should go directly to pediatric hospitals.**

Not marketing budgets. Not executive salaries. The hospitals you work for.

Weird position for a tech company? Maybe. But here's the thing...

You already spend your day caring for children. Why shouldn't your technology investment do the same?

**Email 2 (Day 4) - The Education**
**Subject:** How 60% Allocation Works (And Why It Matters)

Dear [Healthcare Professional],

Quick explainer on how FOR THE KIDS actually works:

Every dollar generated:
- $0.60 → Pediatric Charities & Children's Hospitals (Gospel V1.3)
- $0.30 → Infrastructure, operations, salaries
- $0.10 → Founder sustainability

That ratio is IMMUTABLE. Encoded in our platform. Not changeable.

Why? Because this isn't charity. It's a business model that prioritizes children's health as the core value proposition, not an afterthought.

**The impact math:**

If 100,000 healthcare professionals subscribed to our platform:
- $12M+ annual revenue
- $7.2M → Pediatric charities (60%)
- That's X children helped per month
- That's Y hospitals getting direct support

You'd be part of that.

**Your next step:**

Try our platform for free (30 days for healthcare workers):

No credit card required. See if it actually delivers on what we say.

This is what our healthcare professional community is telling us.

When nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare workers invest in technology, they want that investment to matter.
