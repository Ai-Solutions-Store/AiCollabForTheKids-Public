## 15. FINAL NOTES

### GOSPEL COMPLIANCE

All content MUST adhere to:
- ? **60/30/10 split** (never say 60/30/10)
- ? **"Profit allocation"** (never "contribution" or "treasury")
- ? **"Verified Pediatric Charities"** (never "random charities")
- ? **Brand colors** (Coral, Blue, Teal, Gold, Green)
- ? **"FOR THE KIDS" tagline** (always, everywhere)

### BRAND VOICE

**Tone:**
- Professional but approachable (not corporate)
- Technical but accessible (explain jargon)
- Confident but humble (data-driven, not boastful)
- Mission-driven (always tie back to helping kids)

**Examples:**
- ? "Our planned smart contract (backend enforcement active) smart contract ensures 60% goes to verified pediatric charities"
- ? "We allocate some money to kids"
- ? "goal: help thousands of children (and counting)"
- ? "We've made a difference"

### LONG-TERM VISION

**Year 1:** Establish authority (50+ keywords ranked)
**Year 2:** Dominate niche (200+ keywords, DA 40+)
**Year 3:** Industry leader (500+ keywords, media regular)

**This is not a 6-month sprint. This is a 3-year marathon.**
