🚀 **WE'RE LIVE ON KICKSTARTER!** 🚀

The wait is over! For the Kids is officially launching on Kickstarter, and we need YOUR support to make history.

**🎯 What We're Building:**
An AI-powered collaboration platform that puts 60% of every dollar earned directly into the hands of verified pediatric charities. Not "someday." Not "eventually." From day one.

**💰 The Split:**
- **60%** → Verified Pediatric Charities (Gospel V1.3)
- **30%** → Infrastructure & Development
- **10%** → Founder (who took LESS so kids get MORE)

**🎁 Kickstarter Perks:**
- **$10 Tier:** Digital thank you + name on donor wall
- **$25 Tier:** Beta access + founding member role
- **$50 Tier:** Lifetime 20% discount + charity voting rights
- **$100 Tier:** Premium features + quarterly impact reports
- **$500+ Tiers:** White-glove onboarding, custom integrations, and more

**🔗 BACK US NOW:**
[KICKSTARTER LINK HERE]

**📊 Transparency Promise:**
Every dollar tracked. Every charity verified. Every distribution public.
- Live dashboard: https://aicollabforthekids.com/transparency
- Monthly reports in <#charity-updates>
- On-chain verification via Ethereum smart contracts

**🎉 Launch Week Bonus:**
First 100 backers get an exclusive "Founding 100" Discord role and special perks TBD by community vote.

**Why This Matters:**
We're not asking for donations. We're building a sustainable business that happens to be the most charitable tech company on Earth. You get amazing AI tools. Kids get life-changing support. Everybody wins.

**Let's do this. FOR THE KIDS.** 💙
