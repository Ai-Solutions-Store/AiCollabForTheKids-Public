#### Marketing for Round-Up Program

**Pharmacy Window Signage:**
```
ROUND UP TO HELP KIDS

At checkout, you can round up your
prescription total to support
children's hospitals.

"Can I round up to $50?"
Your prescription: $47.89
You give: $2.11
Kids' hospital gets: $1.27

No amount too small.
Every prescription helps.

Ask your pharmacist about round-up!
```

**Social Media Example (Instagram):**
"One customer. One round-up. One child helped.

[CUSTOMER STORY] came to our pharmacy for a prescription refill. At checkout, she rounded up $2.11 to support pediatric hospitals.

That $2.11 becomes $1.27 in direct hospital funding.

Multiply that by 5,000 customers per month, and we're talking about $6,350 monthly support for children's health.

This is the power of tiny, collective action.

Ask about round-up at our pharmacy.
Every prescription is an opportunity to care."
