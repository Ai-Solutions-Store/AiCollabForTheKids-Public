This program turns genuine action into tangible benefits:
- Points for every advocacy activity

### Charity contribution Options (Philosophy)

**Why Charitable Rewards Matter:**

Some advocates prefer their rewards go to kids directly. We honor that:

```
Redemption Path:
1. Accumulate points
2. Instead of personal reward, choose "contribution Option"
3. Select verified pediatric charity partner
4. We process as $[Points ÷ 10] charitable contribution
5. You get named recognition for the contribution

Example:
500 points ? Can redeem as:
- $50 gift card (personal)
- OR
- $50 contribution to [Charity Partner] in your name
```

**Charity Partner List (Verified):**
- [Partner 1] - Focus area
- [Partner 2] - Focus area
- [Partner 3] - Focus area
- [Plus additional verified charities based on advocate interest]

**Recognition for Charitable Redemptions:**
```
Email + Slack notification:
"[Name] just contributed $[Amount] to [Charity] through their advocacy work.
Their advocacy helped these kids: [Estimated number based on 60% calculation]"

Monthly recognition email highlights all charitable redemptions
```

"Hi [Name],

We noticed your advocacy activity has slowed. No judgment—just wanted to check in.

Is everything okay? Are you:
? Too busy? (We can scale back expectations)
? Lost interest? (Let's talk about what changed)
? Struggling with something? (We have resources)
? Just taking a break? (That's cool—come back when ready)

No pressure either way. But we'd love to hear from you.

[Personal message from mentor/coordinator]

[Link to resources/support]
"
```

[Name], you're a champion. Keep it up!"

Special badge: "5-Figure Impact" (LinkedIn + directory)
```

---

## PART 7: ANTI-GAMING SAFEGUARDS

### Quality Filters

**To prevent manipulation:**

```
Activity Caps:
- Max 2 pre-approved shares per day (prevents spam)
- Max 1 original post per day (maintains quality)
- Max 5 point referral clicks per unique person (prevents self-dealing)

Content Verification:
- Original posts reviewed before points awarded
- Shares tracked to ensure they're actually public
- Referrals require confirmation (not just clicks)

Anomaly Detection:
- Sudden spike in activity flagged for review
- Bot-like patterns trigger manual verification
- Suspicious patterns = points held pending review
```

**If Gaming Detected:**

**Level 1 - Warning:**
```
Private message:
"Hi [Name],

We noticed some unusual activity on your account:
[Specific behavior flagged]

We're not saying it's intentional—could be a misunderstanding.

Let's have a quick call to discuss.

[Meeting link]
"
```

**Level 2 - Education:**
```
If confirmed:
"The points system is designed to reward authentic advocacy,
not activity volume. Here's how we can realign:

[Specific suggestions]

No points removed—just reset expectations going forward.
"
```

**Level 3 - Consequences (Rare):**
```
If repeated:
- Points freeze for 30 days (not removal)
- Ineligible for bonus events during freeze
- 1:1 with program leader required before re-engagement
- Behavioral expectations reset

Philosophy: Education > Punishment
```
