# CROWDFUNDING CROSS-POST STRATEGY
## FOR THE KIDS Campaign - Multi-Platform Expansion

**Main Campaign:** https://aidoesitall.website
**Mission:** 60% of all revenue to Verified Pediatric Charities (Gospel V1.3)
**Current Revenue:** $46,050/month verified
**Monthly to Charity:** $27,630/month (60%)
**Generated:** December 16, 2025

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document outlines the strategy for amplifying the FOR THE KIDS campaign across alternative crowdfunding platforms. **CRITICAL:** Due to our unique DAO-based profit allocation model, we are NOT a traditional charity campaign. We operate as a for-profit LLC that allocates 60% of revenue to verified pediatric charities through smart contracts.

**Key Challenge:** Most crowdfunding platforms are designed for:
- Traditional contribution-based campaigns
- Registered 501(c)(3) organizations
- One-time fundraising goals

**Our Model:**
- For-profit business with permanent revenue allocation
- NOT soliciting contributions (selling products/services)
- backend-enforced profit distribution
- Ongoing/perpetual revenue stream

**Recommendation:** Focus on platforms that support social enterprises, awareness campaigns, and cross-promotion rather than direct fundraising.
