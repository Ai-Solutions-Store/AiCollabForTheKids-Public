**EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM - INTRO MESSAGE**

Subject: New Platform: AI Revenue → 60% to Pediatric Charities (Gospel V1.3)

---

Hi everyone - sharing a project that directly aligns with EA principles.

**FOR THE KIDS:** We built an AI platform that commits exactly 60% of all revenue to verified pediatric charities (not "up to 60%", literally every dollar tracked).

The model is straightforward:
- 60% → 501(c)(3) pediatric charities (children's hospitals, pediatric research, family support)
- 30% → Infrastructure/scaling
- 10% → Founder sustainability (to prevent hustle failure)

**Why this matters to EA:**
- Pre-committed allocation locked in platform architecture
- Charity partners are pre-vetted 501(c)(3) organizations
- Transparent revenue tracking (blockchain verification coming)
- Solves the "poverty of founders doing good" problem

We're not competing with direct giving - we're funding charities that already exist and have demonstrated impact.

**Current traction:**
- Revenue generating (launched September 2025)
- Multiple 501(c)(3) partnerships active
- User growth steady (not hockey stick, but consistent)

If you want to see a novel funding model, or if you know pediatric charities that would benefit from sustained revenue streams, worth a look: **https://aidoesitall.website**

Gospel V1.3 compliance: All documentation on our platform explains the 60% allocation.

Happy to discuss the math, charity partnerships, or why we chose 60% specifically (cost-benefit analysis on founder survival rates was wild).

---

**Why This Works:**
- Leads with impact metric (60% allocation)
- Shows evidence-based thinking
- Treats audience as intelligent equals
- Offers value (novel funding model + analysis)
- Includes campaign URL naturally
- Gospel V1.3 compliant
- Invites deeper engagement without hard sell

**Expected Questions & Answers:**
- "How do you verify the 60%?" → Blockchain verification in development, audit trails on all transactions
- "Which charities?" → (List 3-5 current partners with specific programs)
- "Why not 100%?" → Because we'd be non-profit, which doesn't solve founder retention problem (80% of charity startups fail in year 3)
- "How do you make money?" → (Explain revenue model briefly - service delivery, subscriptions, etc.)

### Template 1B: Indie Hackers / Founder Communities
**Community:** Indie Hackers Discord, YC Startup School, Hustlers

**INDIE HACKERS - INTRO MESSAGE**

Sharing a transparency-first business model that might spark some interesting conversations.

**Project:** FOR THE KIDS - AI platform with 60% revenue → pediatric charities

**The Model:**
- Sell AI tools/services
- Track revenue openly
- 60% automatically allocated to 501(c)(3) pediatric charities
- 30% reinvest in infrastructure
- 10% to founder (yes, I'm naming it upfront)

**Why I'm sharing this:**
- Bootstrapped (no VC, no dilution)
- Repeatable (this model could work for other problems)
- Honest (tired of fake "we care about impact" while keeping 90% of revenue)

**Current Stats (honest numbers):**
- Monthly Revenue: [X]
- Charity Allocation: [Y] per month
- User Growth: [Z%] month-over-month
- Burn Rate: [A] (because we're not losing money)
- Runway: [B] months

**The Challenge I'm Solving:**
Most platforms claim social impact but prioritize growth/VC metrics. We literally can't prioritize growth over charity funding because the model ties them together - bigger revenue = bigger charity allocation.

This creates an interesting constraint: every feature decision factors in "does this help charities" not just "does this convert users."

**For founders thinking about this:** Would love to discuss how similar models could apply to other verticals. Not claiming this is the only way - just showing it's possible.

**Gospel V1.3 (our versioning):** Locked in allocation, transparent math, auditable outcomes.

Check it out: **https://aidoesitall.website**

---

**Why This Works:**
- Founders respect transparency
- Shares real metrics (builds credibility)
- Acknowledges the business challenge candidly
- Invites founder-to-founder conversation
- Shows this isn't just marketing fluff
- Gospel V1.3 naturally woven in
- Campaign URL feels like FYI, not promotion

**Expected Questions & Answers:**
- "How do you stay competitive with lower margins?" → We're not racing venture growth, so different optimization vector
- "Don't the charities want more?" → We offer partnerships that guarantee minimum revenue (sustainable)
- "Why not open-source the model?" → Actually considering this - would love input
- "What's your actual churn rate?" → (Be honest with metrics)

**HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS - INTRO MESSAGE**

Building with healthcare workers in mind - wanted to share what we learned.

**FOR THE KIDS:** Platform generating sustainable funding for pediatric charities and healthcare institutions.

**The Problem We're Solving:**
- Pediatric charities operate on feast-famine funding cycles
- Pediatric healthcare gets underfunded relative to adult specialties
- Healthcare workers see the need firsthand but lack sustainable funding mechanisms

**Our Model:**
- Deliver AI-powered services (productivity, analysis, etc.)
- 60% of revenue → pediatric charities/hospitals
- Charities get predictable, recurring revenue (not one-time contributions)
- Scalable as platform grows

**For Healthcare Workers Specifically:**
- You see pediatric needs every day
- This is a platform that literally ties its success to pediatric care funding
- Revenue grows = pediatric funding grows
- No extraction model (founder takes minimum viable allocation)

**Gospel V1.3 Commitment:**
All allocation percentages locked in, auditable, transparent.

**Clinical/Professional Question:** For pediatric healthcare leaders - would love input on:
- Which programs would benefit most from predictable funding?
- What would make a partnership valuable to your institution?
- Are there specific areas of pediatric care we should prioritize for funding?

**More info:** https://aidoesitall.website

---

**Why This Works:**
- Respects healthcare expertise (asks for input, not just money)
- Uses evidence-based language (sustainable funding, recurring model)
- Addresses real healthcare problem (funding instability)
- Shows respect for healthcare workers' mission
- Gospel V1.3 mentioned as commitment, not gimmick
- Campaign URL feels like resource link

**Expected Questions & Answers:**
- "How do you verify charity impact?" → (Share audit process, partner vetting)
- "Which hospitals are you partnering with?" → (List specific partnerships)
- "What's your overhead?" → 30% infrastructure (show what this covers)
- "Can we partner?" → YES - this is the real conversation

## TIER 2 TEMPLATES: SECONDARY COMMUNITIES

### Template 2A: Social Enterprise / Impact Investors
**Community:** Impact Hub, Charity Entrepreneurs Network
**Tone:** Business-professional, growth-minded, impact-focused
**Context:** This audience understands both profitability AND purpose

---

**IMPACT HUB - INTRO MESSAGE**

Building a social enterprise model and wanted input from the impact community.

**FOR THE KIDS:** Proof-of-concept that social impact can be locked into core business architecture.

**The Challenge:**
Most social enterprises start with mission, then optimize for growth (and mission gets diluted). We started with question: "What if you architecturally can't de-prioritize mission, even if growth demanded it?"

**Our Answer:**
- 60% of revenue locked to pediatric charities via smart contract infrastructure
- 30% to scaling
- 10% to founder
- These percentages literally can't change without public governance process

**Why It Matters:**
- Impact investors get predictable impact metrics
- Charities get recurring, sustainable funding
- Growth doesn't dilute mission (it amplifies it)
- Founder incentives align with mission success

**Current Traction:**
- [Revenue metrics]
- [Charity partnership metrics]
- [User growth metrics]

**For the Impact Community:**
- This model is repeatable across verticals
- Gospel V1.3 is essentially "embedded impact accountability"
- Happy to open-source the framework if others want to build similar models

**Feedback Wanted:**
- What would make this model even more trustworthy?
- Are there impact investors who'd fund similar models?
- What other verticals should this apply to?

**DEV.TO / MEDIUM - INTRO MESSAGE**

**Title:** Building a Business Where Success Means Kids Get Healthcare Funded

**Excerpt:**
We launched FOR THE KIDS with a core constraint: we can't prioritize growth over mission, because mission IS the growth metric. Here's what we learned about building social enterprises.

[Article would cover:]
- Why 60/30/10 is the right split
- How to make impact unbreakable (not just aspirational)
- Metrics that matter (charity dollars over CAC)
- Founder incentive alignment
- Gospel V1.3 - making promises immutable
- Lessons for other builders

**Call to Action:**
If you're thinking about building with social impact, or if you want to learn what we've discovered, check out https://aidoesitall.website

This isn't evangelism - it's open-source thinking about business model design for social good.

## UNIVERSAL TEMPLATES (All Communities)

### When Asked: "How are you verified?"

**Response Template:**

We partner with verified 501(c)(3) pediatric charities. Our Gospel V1.3 protocol mandates exactly 60% revenue allocation - not "up to 60%" but auditable, traceable, immutable.

Verification mechanisms:
- Monthly charity payouts (published on our platform)
- Charity partner validation (they confirm receipt)
- Blockchain audit trail (implementation in progress)
- 3rd-party accounting review (annual)

The key difference: it's not "we promise to give," it's "we built the system so we can't NOT give."

---

### When Asked: "What about tax deductions?"

**Response Template:**

We're a for-profit social enterprise, so your purchase isn't . BUT - 60% of your payment goes directly to 501(c)(3) charities that ARE  on their side.

Think of it as: instead of you contributing to a charity, you buy from us, and We allocate to the charity. The charity side still gets the deduction.

For transparency: the IRS taxes this as income to the charities (which is fine, because the charities then use it for their mission).

---

### When Asked: "Which charities do you partner with?"

**Response Template:**

We partner with verified pediatric healthcare charities including:
- [Specific children's hospital and program]
- [Pediatric research organization with focus area]
- [Family support/mental health organization]
- [Preventive pediatric care program]

All partners are vetted 501(c)(3) organizations. We prioritize:
- Established, trusted institutions
- Specific programs (not overhead)
- Direct pediatric care or research focus
- Measurable outcomes

New partners are evaluated quarterly. If you know a pediatric charity that should be included, we'd love recommendations.

---

### When Asked: "Why is the founder taking 10%?"

**Response Template:**

Honest answer: 80% of charity startups fail in year 3 because founders burn out or get job offers. A founder taking zero allocation either:
- Comes from significant existing wealth (inequality problem)
- Stays until broke, then quits (mission fails)
- Takes a "normal" job to survive, platform dies

Gospel V1.3 locks founder allocation at 10% - not 0% (which fails) and not 20%+ (which would be extractive). This is the minimum viable allocation that enables founder survival.

Think of it as: "what's the smallest amount the founder needs so they don't have to get a normal job?"

The math: if the platform makes $100k/month, the founder gets $10k/month. That's sustainable but not extravagant.

---

### When Asked: "Why pediatric charities specifically?"

**Response Template:**

Several reasons:
1. **Undervaluation:** Pediatric care gets less funding than adult specialties despite massive impact (prevention > treatment)
2. **Founder passion:** Joshua built this for kids, and that focus drives decision-making
3. **Measurable outcomes:** Pediatric charities have clear metrics (kids are alive, healthy, thriving)
4. **Emotional resonance:** People care about kids (even if they're skeptical about charity)
5. **Global need:** Pediatric care gaps exist everywhere

We could do education, mental health, etc. But pediatric healthcare is the lever we're pulling.

---

### When Asked: "Is this actually sustainable?"

**Response Template:**

Good question. Sustainability depends on:

1. **Revenue Growth:** As we scale, charity funding scales (this is the math)
2. **Market Fit:** People need these tools regardless of the charity aspect (tool quality matters)
3. **Charity Demand:** Pediatric charities have unlimited need for sustainable funding (this is guaranteed)
4. **Founder Survival:** 10% allocation is enough to not require outside income (tested)
5. **Economic Resilience:** If market crashes, we cut 30% before cutting charity (honor our commitment)

We're not betting on altruism. We're betting that:
- People will pay for quality tools
- Pediatric charities will accept sustainable funding
- Founder won't quit if they can pay rent

All three are working so far.

---

## RESPONSE PLAYBOOK: Common Objections

### "This seems too good to be true"

Legitimate skepticism. Here's how to verify:
- Check our website for actual charity partners
- Email a charity partner and ask "do you actually receive these allocations?"
- Review our revenue documentation
- See if we're audited (or will be)

We're not asking for faith - we're asking you to verify. That's the whole point.

---

### "Why aren't you non-profit?"

For-profit model enables:
- Rapid iteration (non-profits are slow)
- Founder sustainability (non-profit boards often request volunteer/low-pay leadership)
- Scalability (non-profit restrictions often limit growth)
- Founder accountability (we're risking our own money, not supporter money)

Non-profits are great for distribution of capital that already exists. We're trying to CREATE capital for pediatric charities. Different optimization vector.

---

### "I don't trust that this will actually happen"

Fair. Here's what we're doing:
1. Publishing monthly impact reports
2. Implementing blockchain verification (immutable record)
3. Asking for community governance input (you help shape the rules)
4. Accepting audit requests (we'll submit to outside review)

This isn't "trust us," it's "verify us."
