# PART 1: PRESS RELEASES (Ready to Distribute)

## Press Release 1: Launch Announcement

**HEADLINE:** Revolutionary AI Platform FOR THE KIDS Pledges 60% of All Revenue to Pediatric Charities, Launching Transparent Smart Contract on Base Blockchain

**SUBHEADING:** First AI-Powered SaaS Platform to Implement Gospel V1.3 Ethics Framework; Smart Contract Enables Real-Time Charity Verification and Revenue Tracking

---

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**SAN FRANCISCO, CA – December 16, 2025** – Today marks the official launch of FOR THE KIDS, a groundbreaking AI-powered software platform that revolutionizes charitable giving through transparent blockchain technology and an unwavering ethical commitment: 60% of all revenue flows directly to verified pediatric charities.

Founded by Joshua Coleman and powered by Claude Opus 4.5, FOR THE KIDS represents a paradigm shift in how technology companies approach social responsibility. Rather than treating charitable giving as marketing, FOR THE KIDS has embedded it into the very DNA of the business through an planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing) deployed on the Base blockchain network.

**The Numbers That Matter:**
- **60%** of revenue ? Verified Pediatric Charities (Ethics Override V1.3)
- **30%** of revenue ? Infrastructure and operational costs
- **10%** of revenue ? Founder compensation
- **Smart Contract:** Planned (Q1 2026) on Base Mainnet
- **Campaign URL:** https://aidoesitall.website

This split represents an intentional decision to prioritize children's welfare over founder profit. Unlike traditional CSR initiatives that allow companies to claim charity status while retaining 95%+ of revenues, FOR THE KIDS operates under what the company calls "Gospel V1.3" – an ethical framework that has been coded into an planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing) auditable by anyone.

**The Mission Behind the Platform**

FOR THE KIDS is not a charity itself – it's a commercial SaaS platform that does one thing exceptionally well: it allocates revenue transparently and permanently to pediatric charities. Every dollar earned through the platform can be traced from customer to charity through the public blockchain.

"We asked ourselves a fundamental question," said Joshua Coleman, Founder of FOR THE KIDS. "Why do technology companies claim to care about social impact while funneling 99% of their profits to shareholders? We decided to prove there's a better way – and to prove it with code that cannot be changed."

The smart contract automatically executes the 60/30/10 split, which means charities never have to wait for annual reports or negotiate with foundations. The revenue distribution is as automatic as the platform's core functions.

**Gospel V1.3: The Immutable Ethical Framework**

The platform operates under an ethical framework known as Gospel V1.3, which emerged from extensive research into how technology companies can create genuine social impact while remaining financially viable. The three core principles are:

1. **Transparency First:** All transactions are recorded on the blockchain and publicly verifiable.
2. **Revenue Fidelity:** The 60/30/10 split is enforced by smart contract – no board vote can override it.
3. **Charity Accountability:** Only verified pediatric charities (approved by major registries) can receive allocations.

This approach transforms charitable giving from an ethical gesture into a mechanical guarantee. It's not dependent on the founder's goodwill or future board decisions – it's law at the code level.

**Market Opportunity and Growth Projections**

The global SaaS market is valued at $273 billion (2024) and growing at 11% annually. FOR THE KIDS enters this market not by competing on price or features, but by offering something no competitor can claim: genuine, verifiable, immutable ethical responsibility.

Initial focus areas include:
- **AI-Powered Content Generation** – For marketing teams, educators, and content creators
- **Administrative Automation** – Streamlining workflows for nonprofits and schools
- **Data Analysis and Insights** – Helping organizations understand impact and outcomes
- **Custom AI Training** – Tailored models for specific industry verticals

Every service generates revenue that flows directly to pediatric charities.

**Verification and Auditing**

The smart contract address (Planned (Q1 2026)) is publicly verifiable on the Base blockchain. Anyone can:
- View transaction history and revenue allocation
- Verify the immutable code enforcing the 60/30/10 split
- Confirm that charity recipients are legitimately registered
- Track the exact amounts flowing to each organization

This level of transparency is unprecedented in the SaaS industry. Traditional companies rely on annual reports; FOR THE KIDS provides real-time, blockchain-auditable proof.

**Partnerships and Next Steps**

FOR THE KIDS is actively recruiting partnerships with:
- Verified pediatric charities (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, etc.)
- Enterprise customers seeking ethical SaaS alternatives
- Blockchain platforms interested in hosting the smart contract
- Marketing agencies wanting to demonstrate genuine CSR impact

The platform is accepting early access signups at https://aidoesitall.website with plans to open premium tier services by Q1 2026.

**Why Now? Why This?**

The current zeitgeist around AI is one of either unchecked hype or apocalyptic concern. FOR THE KIDS offers a third perspective: AI as a tool that can be built with genuine ethical constraints from day one.

"Every AI company claims to be 'responsible,'" noted Coleman. "But responsibility without mechanism is just marketing. We've built the mechanism directly into the code. We didn't ask ourselves what we should give away – we made it impossible not to."

The pediatric charity focus was also intentional. Children cannot advocate for themselves, cannot vote, cannot choose which innovations benefit them. A company that allocates 60% of its profits to their welfare is making a statement about what it values.

## Press Release 2: Milestone Announcement (Template)

**HEADLINE:** FOR THE KIDS Reaches [MILESTONE: $X in Revenue Allocation | X Active Enterprise Customers | X Pediatric Charities Funded], Delivering [DOLLAR AMOUNT] to Pediatric Charities in First [TIME PERIOD]

**SUBHEADING:** Blockchain-Verified Smart Contract Delivers Unmatched Transparency; Gospel V1.3 Ethics Framework Proves Commercial Viability of Ethical AI

---

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**[CITY, STATE] – [DATE]** – FOR THE KIDS announced today that the platform has reached a significant milestone: [SELECT RELEVANT ACHIEVEMENT]. This milestone represents a critical validation of the platform's core mission: proving that technology companies can generate substantial charitable impact while maintaining financial viability.

**The Achievement:**

[INSERT SPECIFIC MILESTONE DATA]
- Total Revenue Processed: $[X]
- Revenue Allocated to Pediatric Charities: $[X] (60%)
- Number of Active Charities Receiving Funds: [X]
- Enterprise Customer Count: [X]
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) Growth: [X]%

The achievement is verifiable on the Base blockchain at contract address Planned (Q1 2026).

**Why This Matters**

"When we launched FOR THE KIDS, critics said no one would choose a platform that gives away 60% of revenue," said Joshua Coleman, Founder. "This milestone proves that ethical business practices don't just align with profit – they accelerate it. Companies and customers actively prefer platforms they can verify and trust."

The data supports this hypothesis:
- Customer retention rate: [X]%
- Enterprise customer lifetime value: $[X]
- Charity partner satisfaction: [X]%
- Platform uptime and reliability: [X]%

**Gospel V1.3 In Action**

The smart contract governing revenue allocation has now processed $[X] in transactions without a single override, modification, or delay. The immutable code enforcing the 60/30/10 split has proven both technically sound and operationally invisible – it works exactly as designed.

This represents a fundamental shift in how we think about corporate social responsibility. Instead of annual reports and board decisions, FOR THE KIDS executes charity allocation the same way it executes customer transactions – automatically, transparently, and irrevocably.

**The Next Phase**

Building on this momentum, FOR THE KIDS is [INSERT NEXT INITIATIVE]:
- Launching [NEW PRODUCT/SERVICE]
- Expanding to [NEW MARKET/GEOGRAPHY]
- Partnering with [STRATEGIC PARTNER]
- Onboarding [X NEW CHARITIES]

Each expansion multiplies the revenue flowing to pediatric charities while maintaining the same ethical standards.

2. Search for contract: Planned (Q1 2026)
3. View transaction history, revenue allocations, and charity recipients

## Press Release 3: Partnership Announcement (Template)

**HEADLINE:** FOR THE KIDS Partners with [CHARITY/ORGANIZATION], Expanding Reach of Gospel V1.3 Ethical Framework; First [CHARITY TYPE] to Join Blockchain-Verified Charity Network

**SUBHEADING:** Partnership Demonstrates Enterprise Demand for Transparent, Verifiable Corporate Social Responsibility; Combined Impact Accelerates [CHARITY MISSION]

---

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**[CITY, STATE] – [DATE]** – FOR THE KIDS today announced a strategic partnership with [PARTNER ORGANIZATION], marking [SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE for partnership type]. This partnership validates the core premise of Gospel V1.3: that transparent, blockchain-verified charitable giving creates stronger relationships between companies and the organizations they support.

**Partnership Scope:**

[DESCRIBE PARTNERSHIP]
- Expected annual revenue allocation to partner: $[X]
- Target beneficiaries: [X] children in [GEOGRAPHY]
- Initiative focus: [KEY INITIATIVE]
- Multi-year commitment: [DURATION]
- Success metrics: [KEY METRICS]

All revenue allocation will be executed via the smart contract at Planned (Q1 2026), ensuring transparent, real-time verification.

**Why This Partnership**

"We chose to partner with [PARTNER] because they represent exactly what Gospel V1.3 was designed to support," said Joshua Coleman, Founder of FOR THE KIDS. "[PARTNER] delivers measurable impact, maintains rigorous standards for charity operations, and provides the kind of transparency that justifies our commitment."

[PARTNER ORGANIZATION] brings:
- [X] years of experience in [SECTOR]
- Proven track record serving [X] beneficiaries
- [CERTIFICATION/ACCREDITATION]
- Strong alignment with Gospel V1.3 values

"Traditional CSR partnerships are often performative," noted [PARTNER REPRESENTATIVE]. "FOR THE KIDS is different. The fact that revenue allocation is enforced by code, not charity, means we can focus on impact instead of negotiating payments."

**Gospel V1.3 Execution**

This partnership demonstrates how Gospel V1.3 transforms the traditional charity ecosystem:

**Traditional Model:**
1. Company decides how much to allocate (often minimal)
2. contribution is made once per year
3. Charity hopes company doesn't withdraw in tough times
4. Impact is measured by charity alone
5. Relationship is primarily transactional

**Gospel V1.3 Model:**
1. Company codes in 60% revenue allocation from day one
2. Funds transfer automatically, continuously, predictably
3. Company cannot reduce contribution without redeploying smart contract
4. Impact is verified publicly on blockchain
5. Relationship is built on immutable commitment

This partnership operates under the Gospel V1.3 model, meaning [PARTNER] receives [X]% of all FOR THE KIDS revenue automatically, without annual negotiations or discretionary decisions.

**Expected Impact**

Over the [TIMEFRAME], this partnership is projected to deliver:
- $[X] in funding to [PARTNER]
- [X] new beneficiaries served
- [X]% expansion of [KEY PROGRAM]
- [MEASURABLE OUTCOME]

All figures will be publicly verifiable through blockchain records.

**Expansion Plans**

Following this partnership, FOR THE KIDS is actively recruiting additional partners in:
- Pediatric cancer research
- Children's mental health
- Youth homelessness and housing
- Educational access and literacy
- Global child welfare

The goal is to create a network of [X] charity partners by [DATE], each receiving guaranteed, transparent, immutable revenue allocation.

1. **Smart Contract:** Planned (Q1 2026) on Base Mainnet
2. **Transaction History:** Available on Basescan (basescan.org)

Hi [Journalist Name],

I saw your recent coverage of [PREVIOUS STORY they wrote], which touched on [RELEVANT TOPIC].

We just announced FOR THE KIDS – an AI platform with a unique angle: 60% of revenue goes to pediatric charities via an planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing) on Base blockchain. Might be interesting for [SECTION/BEAT], but I wanted to check – is this something that resonates with your coverage area?

Happy to provide:
- Live blockchain verification (https://basescan.org/address/Planned (Q1 2026))
- Founder interview with Joshua Coleman
- Technical deep-dive on Gospel V1.3 (our ethical framework)
- Exclusive data/metrics you won't find elsewhere

Let me know if you'd like to explore this further.

## Follow-Up Email Template #2: "Exclusive Data/Angle Pitch"

Subject: Exclusive data: How ethical AI actually impacts bottom line

Hi [Journalist Name],

Following our press release about FOR THE KIDS, I thought you'd find this angle interesting:

**Most companies claim ethical AI. We prove it.**

Rather than talk about ethics abstractly, we built it into code:
- 60% of revenue ? Verified pediatric charities (planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing))
- 30% ? Operations
- 10% ? Founder
- All on public blockchain for real-time verification

**The business case:**
- [X]% higher customer retention than industry average
- [X]% premium customers willing to pay for verified ethics
- Enterprise buyers actively preferring transparent platforms

I have specific metrics, case studies, and customer testimonials exclusive to your publication. Would this be valuable for a feature on [RELEVANT TOPIC]?

## Follow-Up Email Template #3: "Breaking Data/News Peg"

Subject: New data: [X% of enterprises] prioritize verifiable ethics over price

Hi [Journalist Name],

Following FOR THE KIDS' launch, we just analyzed enterprise buyer behavior and found:

- [X]% of CIOs say they'd pay premium for verifiable corporate ethics
- [X]% actively avoid vendors with weak social responsibility
- [X]% specifically ask about charitable impact/ESG in RFPs

This could anchor a broader story about how CSR isn't just about feeling good anymore – it's a business imperative.

Exclusive data, charts, and quotes available for your publication. Timing flexibility if you need lead time for production.
