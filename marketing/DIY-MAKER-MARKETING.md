8. Impact Report: Monthly: "This month's auctions raised $X for Y kids"

**Tax/Legal:**
- Maker gets tax receipt for contribution (full item value)
- Winner gets receipt (for charitable contribution portion, if any)
- Charity gets direct deposit of funds
- Documentation: All tracked in spreadsheet

### Phase 5: Auction Revenue Model

**Per-Auction Metrics (Monthly):**
- Items listed: 45-60
- Average item value: $50-$500
- Average starting bid: 30% of value = $15-$150
- Average final price: 60-80% of value = $30-$400
- Success rate (items that sell): 70% = 31-42 items sold

**Monthly Revenue Calculation:**
```
Conservative Estimate:
- 35 items sold � $200 average final bid = $7,000 total revenue
- Processing fees (2-3%): -$210
- FOR THE KIDS cut (remaining after charity):
  * Gospel V1.3: 60% to charity, 30% infrastructure, 10% founder
  * Actually: From net revenue, typically 30-40% platform revenue
  * $7,000 � 40% = $2,800

Optimistic Estimate:
- 50 items sold � $350 average final bid = $17,500 total revenue
- Processing fees (2%): -$350
- FOR THE KIDS cut (40%): $6,860
```

**Annual Revenue (12 auctions):**
- Conservative: $2,800 � 12 = $33,600
- Mid-range: $4,000 � 12 = $48,000
- Optimistic: $6,860 � 12 = $82,320
- **Year 1 Target: $48,000-$82,320**
