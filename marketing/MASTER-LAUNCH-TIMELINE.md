   Hi [Name],

   I'm reaching out personally because we launched FOR THE KIDS
   today and we're behind where we need to be.

   We're at $[X] of our $50K goal. I need 100 backers in the next
   48 hours to keep momentum alive.

   Can you:
   1. Back for any amount ($1 helps)
   2. Share with 3 people who care about kids' charities
   3. Reply and tell me you did it (accountability)

   60% of every dollar → verified pediatric charities.

    - Retarget website visitors
    - A/B test creative

14. **Partnership Outreach:**
    - Approach complementary Kickstarters
    - Cross-promote with charity organizations
    - Ask existing backers to become ambassadors

**Red Lines (Don't Do These):**
- ❌ Spam communities
- ❌ Buy fake backers
- ❌ Misrepresent charity partnerships
- ❌ Panic-pivot the core mission
- ❌ Give up before Day 7

**Mental Game:**
- Most Kickstarters are slow starts
- Week 2-3 often outperform Week 1
- Fundraising is a marathon, not sprint
- Every "no" gets you closer to "yes"

**Remember:**
- Kickstarter campaigns can succeed with slow starts
- 30% of funding often comes in final 48 hours
- Use early struggles as content/story fuel
- Community rallies around authentic struggle

## GOSPEL V1.3 REMINDER

**Every piece of content MUST include:**

"60% of all revenue → Verified Pediatric Charities"

**Never say:**
- ❌ "60% to charity"
- ❌ "Half to kids"
- ❌ "Most profits to charity"

**Always say:**
- ✅ "60% to verified pediatric charities"
- ✅ "60/30/10 transparent split"
- ✅ "Gospel V1.3: 60% kids, 30% infrastructure, 10% founder"

**This is our differentiator. This is our mission. This is FOR THE KIDS.**

## MOTIVATIONAL CLOSE

You've prepared for weeks.
You've built something remarkable.
You've assembled a team.
You've crafted the message.

Now it's time to execute.

Day 1 will be chaos. That's normal.
Something will go wrong. That's expected.
You'll want to quit at hour 8. That's part of it.

But remember:

Every dollar raised = $0.60 to sick kids.
Every backer = A believer in transparent charity.
Every share = A ripple of impact.

You're not just launching a Kickstarter.
You're proving charity can be transparent.
You're showing blockchain has purpose.
You're putting kids first.

**FOR THE KIDS. 60/30/10. Gospel V1.3.**

Now go launch. 🚀
