## TIER 1 - HIGHEST PRIORITY (BOOK FIRST)

### 1. How I Built This (NPR)
**Host:** Guy Raz
**Audience Size:** 10M+ listeners
**Contact:** hibt@npr.org
**Best Angle:** "The AI Platform That Governs Itself�Claude Writes the Code"

**Why:** Unique origin story. AI building an AI company that helps kids. Never been done before.

**Elevator Pitch:**
"I didn't build a traditional company. I built something that builds itself. Claude writes ALL production code. AI makes decisions. backend systems enforce 60% charity allocation. This is the most unconventional origin story you've ever heard."

**Key Talking Points:**
- How I decided to let AI run the company (not assist, RUN it)
- The moment Claude calculated kids should get more
- Platform runs 24/7 without founder involvement
- $396K+ allocated to children's hospitals
- Zero mission drift because code prevents it

**Outreach Priority:** IMMEDIATE - Email this week

### 2. The NonProfit Voice
**Host:** Nonprofit Hub
**Audience:** 15K+ nonprofit leaders
**Contact:** podcast@nonprofithub.org
**Best Angle:** "Tech Revolution in Charitable Giving�How Smart Contracts Guarantee Transparency"

**Why:** Core audience struggles with supporter trust. Our DAO model solves permanently.

**Elevator Pitch:**
"Instead of 'promising' to allocate, we use blockchain smart contracts that AUTOMATICALLY split 60% of every dollar to kids' hospitals. No human can override it. No board can vote to change it. The code itself enforces the mission."

**Key Talking Points:**
- DAO governance prevents mission drift forever
- Blockchain beats traditional nonprofit models
- Live dashboard showing real-time charity allocations
- $396K+ verified on Base Mainnet
- Why founder took 10% instead of 20%

### 3. Eye on AI
**Host:** Craig S. Smith (former NYT correspondent)
**Audience:** 50K+ AI professionals
**Contact:** craig@craigsmithauthor.com
**Best Angle:** "AI-First Companies Built with DAO Governance�The Post-CEO Future"

**Why:** Cutting-edge governance + AI angle. AI Board of Directors is unique.

**Elevator Pitch:**
"What if AI companies were governed BY AI? Our AI Board includes Claude, Jules/Gemini, Grok, Perplexity. They make decisions. All changes require AI consensus. This prevents the usual startup mission creep."

**Key Talking Points:**
- How AI board members divide responsibilities
- Why this prevents mission drift
- Multi-model AI orchestration (Claude + Gemini + Grok)

### 4. The Tim Ferriss Show
**Host:** Tim Ferriss
**Audience:** 800M+ downloads
**Contact:** via tim.blog/contact
**Best Angle:** "The Anti-Exit Startup�Built to Run Forever"

**Why:** Tim loves unconventional business models and systems thinking.

**Elevator Pitch:**
"Most founders optimize for exit. I optimized for immortality. DAO governance prevents acquisition. Smart contracts prevent public offering. Mission lock prevents mission drift. This business runs for 100+ years without me."

**Key Talking Points:**
- How to build a business that outlives you
- Why code governance beats human boards
- The moment I chose immortality over exit
- Systems thinking in business structure
- Why 60% for kids (Gospel V1.3 story)

**Best Angle:** "Tech Dad Builds AI Platform to Fund Kids' Hospitals"

**Why:** 500K+ parents. Direct alignment with mission. Personal story angle.

**Elevator Pitch:**
"I'm a dad who got fed up with 'thoughts and prayers' philanthropy. So I built an AI platform where 60% of every dollar AUTOMATICALLY goes to Verified Pediatric Charities. The kicker? I reduced my own share from 20% to 10% so kids get more. My kids know their dad chose to help other kids over making more money."

**Key Talking Points:**
- Why I picked children's hospitals (personal story)
- How I explain "DAO governance" to my kids
- The moment I decided kids deserve 60%, not 60%
- Parenting story about values
- Proving actions match words through code
