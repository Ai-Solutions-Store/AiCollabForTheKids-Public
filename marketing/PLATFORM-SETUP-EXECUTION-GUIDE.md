Reddit has strict anti-spam measures. You CANNOT post promotional content until:
- ? Account is 30+ days old
- ? 500+ karma (combined post + comment karma)
- ? No recent violations or downvotes
- ? Authentic participation in communities

**Karma Building Tactics (2-4 weeks):**

**Week 1-2: Lurk and Comment**
- Join subreddits: r/entrepreneur, r/startups, r/artificial, r/charity, r/technology
- Comment on 5-10 posts daily (genuine, helpful feedback)
- Upvote quality content
- DO NOT mention your product yet

**Week 3-4: Start Posting**
- Share valuable content in relevant subs (tutorials, insights, questions)
- Participate in "Daily Discussion" threads
- Answer questions from others (build authority)
- Target: 100+ comment karma, 50+ post karma

**Step 4: First Promotional Post (Day 30+)**

**Post in r/SideProject:**
```
Title: I built an AI platform where 60% of revenue goes to kids' hospitals (smart contract enforced)

Body:
Hey r/SideProject,

I'm Joshua, a systems engineer and father who spent the last year building FOR THE KIDS - an AI collaboration platform with an unusual business model.

THE TWIST: 60% of all revenue automatically flows to verified pediatric charities. Not "eventually." Not "after costs." Every transaction. Enforced by Ethereum smart contracts.

WHY: I got tired of tech companies talking about "doing good" while optimizing for extraction. So I built something different: a platform where charity isn't a side project�it's the core business model.

THE TECH:
- Multi-AI routing (Claude, Gemini, Grok)
- DAO governance for charity selection
- Smart contracts for Transparent allocation
- 100% transparent blockchain tracking

CURRENT STATUS: Live on Base Mainnet, goal: help thousands of children (projected)

I'm not here to promote (yet). Just sharing what I've built and would love feedback from fellow builders.

Smart Contract: Planned (Q1 2026)
Website: https://aidoesitall.website

Happy to answer any questions about the architecture, the mission, or why I chose 60% instead of 50%.

FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS.
```

**Time Estimate:** 10 minutes setup + 2-4 weeks karma building
**Verification Requirements:** Email only
