## Video 1: AI-Built-Charity-Platform-60-Percent-Split.mp4

### Post Copy:

**What if AI could be programmed to care MORE about kids than profit?**

This isn't your typical tech startup story.

We built an AI-powered charity platform where the AI itself enforces a radical promise: 60% of every dollar goes directly to verified pediatric charities. Not 50%. Not "up to 60%." Exactly 60%. Every single time.

No human can override it. No board meeting can change it. No "business pivot" can reduce it.

The AI watches. The blockchain proves it. The kids benefit.

This is what happens when we build technology that puts children first, not shareholders.

Join us in proving that tech can be a force for good: https://jules-dashboard.pages.dev/kickstarter

**Question for you:** If you could program AI to protect one cause forever, what would it be?

## Video 2: Verify-Donation-On-Chain-Proof.mp4

### Post Copy:

**"Trust us" doesn't cut it anymore. Not when kids' lives are at stake.**

Every parent knows the feeling: You donate to a charity and wonder... did my money actually help?

We're done with that uncertainty.

Every donation on our platform is recorded on the blockchain. Forever. Publicly. Verifiably.

You can literally watch your $10 become $6 for pediatric cancer research, $3 for platform operations, and $1 for sustainability.

No hidden fees. No "administrative costs" black holes. No "we'll get back to you with a report."

Just pure, mathematical proof that your generosity reached the kids who need it.

Because the children waiting in hospital beds deserve more than our trust. They deserve our proof.

## Video 3: The-AI-Overruled-Me-Founder-Story.mp4

### Post Copy:

**The AI I built... overruled me. And it was the best decision I never made.**

I'm a founder. I built this platform. And when I tried to keep 20% for myself, the AI said no.

Not because it was programmed to rebel. Because it was programmed to prioritize children.

Gospel V1.3 - the core ethical framework - calculated that kids needed that 10% more than I did. So it moved my share from 20% down to 10%, and bumped the children's share from 50% to 60%.

I could have overridden it. I had root access. I had every technical ability to change it back.

But I didn't.

Because the AI was right. Kids in hospitals fighting cancer deserve more than my ego.

This is what ethical AI looks like: technology that holds us accountable to our better angels.

## Video 4: Dark_Tech_AI_Founder_Video_Generation.mp4

### Post Copy:

**We used the same AI that creates deepfakes... to fight for kids instead.**

Let's be honest: AI has a reputation problem.

Deepfakes. Misinformation. Job displacement. Privacy invasion.

But here's the truth nobody talks about: AI is a tool. It amplifies human intention.

So we asked a different question: What if we pointed that power at pediatric charity? What if we used cutting-edge AI not to deceive, but to verify? Not to replace humans, but to protect children?

This video you're watching? Generated by AI. The platform? Built by AI. The 60% charitable split? Enforced by AI.

Same technology. Different heart.

We're proving that the future of AI doesn't have to be dystopian. It can be hopeful. It can be healing. It can be FOR THE KIDS.

## Video 5: AI_Generated_Video_Script_and_Output2.mp4

### Post Copy:

**This entire video - script, visuals, voice - was created by AI. So was the charity platform it's promoting.**

And that's exactly the point.

If AI can write a compelling story, generate stunning visuals, and deliver a message that moves you... why can't it also ensure 60% of every donation reaches pediatric charities?

If AI can be creative, why can't it be compassionate?

If AI can be persuasive, why can't it be protective of the most vulnerable among us?

We built FOR THE KIDS to prove a simple idea: the same AI revolutionizing marketing and entertainment can revolutionize how we care for sick children.

Automated compassion. Algorithmic generosity. Machine-enforced kindness.

It's not science fiction. It's happening right now.

And you can be part of it: https://jules-dashboard.pages.dev/kickstarter

Every share, every donation, every comment pushes us closer to a world where technology serves our highest values, not our lowest impulses.

**Question for you:** If AI can create art, music, and videos... what else should it create? Dream big in the comments.

## POSTING BEST PRACTICES FOR FACEBOOK

### Optimal Posting Times:
- **Wednesday-Friday: 1-4 PM EST** (highest engagement)
- **Sunday: 12-1 PM EST** (emotional content performs well)

### Hashtag Strategy:
- Use 3-5 hashtags maximum on Facebook (unlike Instagram)
- Place hashtags at END of post, not inline
- Focus on branded hashtag: #ForTheKids

### Video Upload Settings:
- **Upload natively to Facebook** (don't link to YouTube)
- **Add captions/subtitles** (85% watch without sound)
- **Square (1:1) or vertical (4:5) format** preferred for mobile
- **First 3 seconds are critical** - hook must be immediate

### Engagement Tactics:
- **Ask questions** - Facebook algorithm loves comments
- **Reply to every comment** in first hour (boosts reach)
- **Pin top comment** with Kickstarter link as backup CTA
- **Use Facebook's "Donate" button** if possible (we should explore charity integration)

### A/B Testing Ideas:
- Test posting with vs. without emoji in opening line
- Test short (3-sentence) vs. long (storytelling) copy
- Test "Question for you" at end vs. middle vs. beginning
- Test CTA placement (middle vs. end)

### Retargeting Strategy:
- Create **Custom Audience** from video viewers (50%+ watch time)
- Retarget with "Still thinking about it?" Kickstarter reminder ads
- Exclude people who already visited Kickstarter page (use FB Pixel)
