NOTICE: We Discovered a Charity Allocation Discrepancy (And We Fixed It)

Dear FOR THE KIDS Community,

On [DATE] at [TIME] UTC, we discovered that [NUMBER] transactions were allocated
to verified pediatric charities at [X]% instead of our committed 60%.

This was a Gospel V1.3 violation, and we're taking full responsibility.

THE FACTS:
? Root cause: [SPECIFIC TECHNICAL ISSUE]
? Transactions affected: [NUMBER]
? Customers impacted: [NUMBER]
? Total charity shortfall: $[AMOUNT]
? Discovery date: [DATE]
? Status: FIXED and remediated

WHAT WE DID IMMEDIATELY:
1. Paused all new transactions (to preserve evidence)
2. Engaged forensic investigators
3. Audited every affected transaction
4. Identified and fixed the root cause
5. Backfilled all affected charities

HOW WE FIXED IT:
? [SPECIFIC TECHNICAL FIX DESCRIPTION]
? New smart contract version: [VERSION]
? Deployment: [DATE] UTC
? All allocations verified on-chain

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:
? If you were affected: You receive [COMPENSATION] (automatically applied)
? Your original 60% allocation: Guaranteed and now delivered to charities
? Future transactions: 60% guaranteed by fixed smart contract
? Charities: Received backfilled amounts on [DATE]

TRANSPARENCY:
? Live audit dashboard: [LINK]
? Smart contract verification: [BASESCAN LINK]
? Every affected transaction listed: [LINK]
? Charity confirmation letters: [LINKS]

WHY THIS HAPPENED:
[TECHNICAL EXPLANATION IN PLAIN LANGUAGE]

WHY WE CAUGHT IT:
We have Gospel compliance monitoring that checks allocation accuracy continuously.
This system did exactly what it was designed to do: catch our mistakes immediately.

WHY YOU SHOULD TRUST US NOW:
? The 60% is hardcoded in smart contract (no human can override)
? Every transaction is publicly auditable on blockchain
? We detected our own mistake (not external whistleblower)
? We fixed it immediately (not delayed)
? We published complete transparency (not hid issue)
? We compensated affected customers (not argued with them)

THIS IS EXACTLY WHY WE USE BLOCKCHAIN:
The mission is protected even from ourselves. We can't cheat, even if we wanted to.

NEXT STEPS:
? Enhanced monitoring: Allocation checks every hour (not daily)
? Third-party audit: Quarterly verification by independent firm
? Public dashboard: Real-time allocation visibility
? Monthly reports: We'll publish allocation accuracy metrics

Joshua Coleman (Founder) Statement:
"We built FOR THE KIDS with one immutable principle: 60% to verified pediatric
charities. When we failed that principle—even accidentally—we acknowledged it,
fixed it, and learned from it. That's what accountability looks like. The children
are helped. The mission continues. And I take personal responsibility for ensuring
this never happens again."
