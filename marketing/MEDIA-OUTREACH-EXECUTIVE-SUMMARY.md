## THE TIER 1 STRATEGY (Week 2-4)

### Top 3 Target Publications (EXCLUSIVE OFFER)

**Tactic:** Offer REAL exclusivity to your Top 3 journalists

**Mechanics:**
- 48-hour exclusive: You publish first, everyone waits
- Full access: Extended interview, technical docs, live demos
- No embargo: You can publish whenever ready
- Competitive advantage: They get the story first in their peer group

**Target Publications (customize based on publication style):**

| Publication | Best Angle | Journalist Research |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **TechCrunch** | "AI platform that hardcoded its mission" | AI/governance beat reporter |
| **Forbes** | "Founder who cut his own equity" | Entrepreneurs/Leadership |
| **Wired** | "Smart contracts for governance" | Technology/Future |

**Pitch Template Locations:**
- TechCrunch ? PITCH-TEMPLATES-TIER1-PUBLISHERS.md (Part 1)
- Forbes ? PITCH-TEMPLATES-TIER1-PUBLISHERS.md (Part 2)
- Fast Company ? PITCH-TEMPLATES-TIER1-PUBLISHERS.md (Part 3)
- Wired ? PITCH-TEMPLATES-TIER1-PUBLISHERS.md (Part 4)

### Secondary Tier (Week 3-4)

**Target:** 5-8 journalists
**Tactic:** "Priority access" (but not exclusive)
**Message:** "You're in the first wave"
**Template:** PR-MEDIA-PITCHES.md (Template 1 + customization)

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

   - Show you understand their beat
   - Customize each pitch

3. **Not following up**
   - 3 follow-ups is standard
   - Don't give up after first "no"
   - But also know when to move on (Day 30)

4. **Being pushy**
   - Respect their time
   - Don't pitch during breaking news
   - Don't demand responses

5. **Poor interview prep**
   - Joshua should know likely questions
   - Practice key soundbites
   - Have documentation ready
   - Understand journalist's angle

6. **Ignoring published coverage**
   - Thank journalists immediately
   - Share widely
   - Use for leverage with others
   - Track what works (which angles get coverage)

## ONGOING CONTENT CREATION

### Create These (Journalists Will Follow)

**Monthly:**
- [ ] One detailed blog post on mission/philosophy
- [ ] One technical deep-dive (smart contracts, code, etc.)

**Quarterly:**
- [ ] Research report or survey
- [ ] Case study on how specific features work
- [ ] Industry perspective/hot takes
- [ ] "State of the space" analysis

**Why it matters:** Journalists read what you publish. Good content attracts coverage.
