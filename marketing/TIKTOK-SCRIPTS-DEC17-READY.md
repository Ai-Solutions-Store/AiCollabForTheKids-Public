### Long Caption (Instagram):
```
[Hook line from script]

[2-3 sentence explanation of the concept]

Here's how it works:
? You purchase AI tools
? Revenue generated
? 60% automatically flows to verified pediatric hospitals via smart contract
? 30% keeps servers running
? 10% to founder (sustainable development)

This isn't a promise. It's code. Gospel V1.3.

Smart Contract: Planned (Q1 2026)
Verify it yourself on BaseScan.

We're 18 days into Kickstarter with a $100K goal.
Hit it = $60K to verified pediatric charities.

## ENGAGEMENT RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### "How does it work?"
```
Great question! Every time someone uses our AI platform, 60% of that revenue automatically flows to verified pediatric hospitals via blockchain smart contract. It's hardcoded - can't be changed by anyone. That's Gospel V1.3 ?? Link in bio to learn more!
```

### "Is this real?"
```
100% real! Our smart contract is deployed on Base mainnet (Planned (Q1 2026)). You can verify every transaction yourself on BaseScan. Proof > Promises. Link in bio to back us on Kickstarter! ??
```

### "I'm in!"
```
LEGEND ?? Thank you for believing in the mission. Every backer builds a platform that will allocate MILLIONS to kids over its lifetime. See you on the other side. FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS. ??
```

### "Why not 100% to charity?"
```
Fair question! 30% covers infrastructure (servers, APIs, dev costs) and 10% founder pay keeps the lights on. A sustainable business allocates revenue forever. A bankrupt charity allocates never. Gospel V1.3 is designed for infinite impact ??
```

### "This seems too good to be true"
```
Appreciate the skepticism - it's healthy! Here's proof: 1) Smart contract on Base (verify at BaseScan.org), 2) Kickstarter verification, 3) LLC registration (EIN 33-4655313), 4) GitHub public code. Every transaction is blockchain-tracked. See for yourself ??
