## RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Market-Specific Risks

**Regulatory Risks:**
- GDPR/LGPD changes: Monitor EU and Brazilian regulatory updates
- Currency controls: Diversify payment processors
- Charity registration delays: Engage local consultants early

**Competitive Risks:**
- Local charity platforms: Partner rather than compete
- Tech giants entering space: Emphasize authenticity, mission focus
- Economic downturns: Create "micro-giving" options (₹100/$1 contributions)

**Operational Risks:**
- Payment processor outages: Secondary processor per market
- Cultural misunderstandings: Native speaker review of ALL messaging
- Hospital partnership failures: Maintain 3+ partners per market backup

**Communications Risks:**
- Messaging tone-deafness: Hire regional marketing consultants
- Exploitation concerns: Never feature identifiable suffering children
- Founder credibility: Transparent financials published quarterly

### Contingency Plans
1. **If GDPR enforcement increases:** Shift to contextual targeting, reduce tracking
2. **If currency crashes (e.g., INR, MXN):** Increase local payment method prominence
3. **If influencer backs out:** Pre-establish micro-influencer ambassador network
4. **If hospital partner rejects:** Maintain updated backup list, pivot quickly
