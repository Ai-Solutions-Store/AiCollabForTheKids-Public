Title: "FOR THE KIDS - Automatic 60% Revenue Split to Verified Pediatric Charities"

Hi r/charity!

We launched a platform where 60% of ALL revenue goes to verified pediatric charities. No treasury. No excuses. Backend system enforces the split on Base Mainnet.

Not asking for contributions - we're a tech company that happens to allocate profits.

Gaming streamers and creators can embed our widget, their viewers can contribute, and we guarantee where the money goes.

Thoughts on the model? What would make you trust it more?

[Link to Gospel.md transparency docs]

Edit: Gold awards go to [Kids Charity]. Thanks for the support!"
```

**Template 2: Creator-Focused (r/SmallStreamers)**
```
Title: "Free Charity Stream Widget - Monetize & Help Kids Simultaneously"

Hey Small Streamers,

We built a widget that sits in your stream overlay. Viewers can contribute directly. You get 10% affiliate commission. 60% goes to verified pediatric charities. 30% pays for infrastructure.

No third-party processing. No charity middleman. Smart contract handles the split.

If you've wanted to do charity streams but felt icky about the platforms, this is for you.

DM if interested in beta testing. First 100 streamers get featured on our platform.

[Demo Video Link]
```

**Template 3: Discussion Starter (r/truegaming)**
```
Title: "Hot Take: Gaming Industry Should Allocate Profits to Child Health, Not Marketing"

The gaming community raised $200M+ for charity in 2024. Gamers CARE.

But why do they have to give EXTRA when companies could just... allocate profits?

We're testing a model: 60% of all revenue goes to pediatric charities automatically.

Is this realistic? Naive? What would it take for gaming companies to do this?

Discuss.

What if Extra Life participants could FUNDRAISE using our platform?

in side streams throughout the year.

What if you could systematize that?

FOR THE KIDS + Games Done Quick could host quarterly speedrun marathons
where the profit split is automatic and transparent.

January: AGDQ-style (Winter Speedruns for Kids)
June: Summer Speedruns for Kids
September: Charity Classic
November: Extra Life Extended

We handle the platform. You handle the events. Kids get 60%."
```

**Angle 2: Individual Speedrunner Partnership**

## MESSAGING (Gospel V1.3 Compliant)

### Core Message Framework

**NOT:** "Please support to help kids"
**YES:** "Your gaming purchases help kids. We guarantee 60%."

**NOT:** "Charity treasury"
**YES:** "Profit allocation through smart contracts"

**NOT:** "revenue allocation"
**YES:** "Revenue-shared with verified pediatric charities"

### Tagline Options

## CONCLUSION

The gaming and streaming community is the LARGEST untapped channel for FOR THE KIDS.

**Why This Matters:**
- Gaming communities raised $700M+ for charity in 2024
- Twitch/YouTube streaming has 1B+ monthly viewers
- Esports tournaments draw 200M+ spectators globally

**Our Competitive Advantage:**
- No contribution language (smart-contract-based revenue share)
- Transparent 60/30/10 split (Gospel V1.3)
- Professional infrastructure (unlike amateur charity platforms)
