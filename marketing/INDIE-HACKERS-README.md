## What You'll Need

**To get started:**
1. Indie Hackers account (free)
2. Updated metrics (revenue, customer count, etc.)
3. Charity partner name + confirmation
4. Smart contract address + audit link
5. Professional headshot (for profile)
6. 1-2 hours/week commitment

**To customize posts:**
1. Your actual financial numbers
2. Your real story/journey
3. Actual customer/user metrics
4. Real charity partner details
5. Authentic voice (not generic)

---

## Common Customizations

### If your numbers are smaller:
```
Don't hide them. Be honest.
"We hit $8K MRR in Month 3 (slower than expected, here's why)"
Builders respect honesty more than inflated numbers.
```

### If you don't have financial transparency review:
```
Get it audited, or explain publicly why you're waiting.
Transparency about security = trust.
Transparency about timeline = trust.
```

### If you have different allocation model:
```
Use same structure, different percentages.
Explain the philosophy (not the specific numbers).
The principle (structured allocation) matters more.
```

### If you're not bootstrapped/solo:
```
Adjust the "founder story" to your situation.
Same principles apply (transparency, constraint, values).
Include your co-founders.
```

- Technical founders (not charity-washing)
- Transparent operators (auditable, verifiable)
- Authentic bootstrappers (real constraints, real decisions)
- Builders' builders (speaking their language)
- Thought leaders (on profit allocation, infrastructure, ethics)

Execute it consistently, and by Year 1 you'll be the reference point for "how to structure ethical startups."
