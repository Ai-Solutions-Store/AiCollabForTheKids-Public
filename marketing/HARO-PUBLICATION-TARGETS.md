## TRACKING PUBLICATION TIER IN YOUR SPREADSHEET

Add this column to your tracking sheet:

**Publication Tier:** [1/2/3/4/5]

Then monthly calculate:
- Tier 1 publication rate: [#] published ÷ [#] sent = [#]%
- Tier 2 publication rate: [#] published ÷ [#] sent = [#]%
- Tier 3 publication rate: [#] published ÷ [#] sent = [#]%

This helps you optimize where to spend time.
