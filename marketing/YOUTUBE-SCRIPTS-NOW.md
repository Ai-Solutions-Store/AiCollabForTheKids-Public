## MAIN POINT #1: The Problem (0:45-1:30)

**ON SCREEN:**
- Split screen: Traditional tech company vs FOR THE KIDS
- Pie charts comparing revenue splits

**NARRATOR:**
"Here's the problem with most tech platforms: They say they 'give back,' but it's all discretionary.

A tech company makes a billion dollars. Maybe they donate 1% to charity for tax purposes. Maybe. The founder keeps 70-80% of profits. Investors get their dividends. And the people who actually need help? They get whatever's left over.

But what if we flipped that model entirely?"

**ON SCREEN:**
- Traditional Tech: "95% → Shareholders | 3% → Founder | 2% → Charity?"
- FOR THE KIDS: "60% → Verified Pediatric Charities | 30% → Infrastructure | 10% → Founder"

**B-ROLL:**
- Stock footage of corporate boardrooms (with overlay filter)
- Dollar signs flowing into executive accounts
- Hospital beds (respectful, not exploitative)
- Children's hospital exterior shots
- Transition to FOR THE KIDS dashboard showing real-time split

## MAIN POINT #2: The Solution (1:30-2:45)

**ON SCREEN:**
- Live screen recording of aidoesitall.website
- Transaction flow visualization

**NARRATOR:**
"Meet FOR THE KIDS - aidoesitall.website.

This isn't a charity. We're a for-profit LLC. But our profit allocation is different.

Here's how it works: You subscribe to one of our AI services - ChatGPT wrappers, automation tools, AI-powered workflows. Your payment hits our gateway through Stripe or Square.

The moment that payment clears, our backend automatically calculates the 60/30/10 split.

60% is allocated to Verified Pediatric Charities. Not as a donation. As profit allocation.

30% reinvests in infrastructure - servers, APIs, development, scaling.

10% goes to me, the founder. Because even mission-driven platforms need to be sustainable.

This split is hardcoded in our backend logic. It's being deployed to a smart contract on Base blockchain. No one can change it. Not investors. Not the board. Not even me.

The code doesn't care about quarterly earnings. It doesn't care about shareholder pressure. It just executes the mission. 60%. Every time."

**NARRATOR:**
"But here's where it gets interesting. We built an AI-powered income stream that feeds directly into this 60/30/10 split.

Meet the Claude Income-Droid. It's an automated YouTube Shorts system that generates 4 videos per day using a unique concept: 'Yesterday's news, today's clarity.'

Every morning at 6 AM, the droid pulls yesterday's technology headlines and creates a 60-second clarity video. Then at 11 AM, business news. At 5 PM, science and health. At 9 PM, entertainment and culture.

The droid writes the script using Claude AI. Generates the voiceover. Edits the video. Uploads to YouTube. All automatically.

These Shorts are monetized through YouTube's Partner Program. Every dollar of ad revenue flows through the same 60/30/10 split.

So when you watch a Claude Droid video, you're not just getting clarity on yesterday's news. You're directly funding pediatric charities. Automatically."

60% is calculated immediately. Logged in PostgreSQL. Recorded with a timestamp, transaction ID, and allocation details.

This isn't manual. This isn't discretionary. The code executes the split before anything else happens.

If you pay $100, the backend immediately calculates:
- $60 to Verified Pediatric Charities
- $30 to infrastructure
- $10 to founder

This happens in milliseconds. Automatically. Every time."

Here's the contract code. It's written in Solidity. The 60/30/10 split is hardcoded as constants.

Not in a config file. Not in a database. In a deployed smart contract that cannot be modified.

Once this contract is deployed, it's immutable. I can't change it. No one can. Not even if the company gets sold. Not even if investors demand it.

The blockchain doesn't care about shareholder pressure. It just executes the mission.

Contract deployment is planned for Q1 2026. When it goes live, every allocation will be recorded on-chain. Permanently. Transparently."

"But let's be real. This isn't just about the PC.

We're building a platform where 60% of revenue goes to Verified Pediatric Charities. Automatically. Immutably. Locked in code.

Our Kickstarter goal is $100,000. If we hit that:
- $60,000 goes to kids in hospitals
- $30,000 reinvests in platform infrastructure
- $10,000 goes to sustainable founder income

Every pledge tier unlocks AI services, platform access, and founding member benefits. But the real unlock is helping thousands of children.

If we can get 1,000 backers at $100 each, that's $60,000 to pediatric charities. That's 30 children helped at $2,000 per treatment.

The gaming PC is the hook. The mission is the reason.

So when you back us, you're not just entering a giveaway. You're joining a movement where AI profits go where they should - to kids who need them."

## MAIN POINT #3: Why AI is More Trustworthy Than Humans (3:00-4:00)

**ON SCREEN:**
- Side-by-side comparison: Human governance vs AI governance

**NARRATOR:**
"Here's the uncomfortable truth: Humans change their minds.

A founder starts with good intentions. 'We'll give 60% to charity!' But then investors want returns. The market shifts. Legal advises against it.

So the split becomes 40%. Then 20%. Then 'we'll donate when we're profitable.'

AI doesn't do that.

The code I deployed doesn't care about market conditions. It doesn't care about investor pressure. It doesn't have a mortgage to pay.

It just executes the Gospel. 60%. Every transaction. Every time.

That's not cold or heartless. That's the most trustworthy version of 'for the kids' I could build.

I intentionally took the decision out of human hands. Because humans - even good ones - can be corrupted. Code can't."

**ON SCREEN:**
1. Human company lifecycle: Good intentions → Investor pressure → Mission drift
2. AI-governed company: Gospel V1.3 → Immutable → No drift possible
3. Smart contract code: CHARITY_PERCENTAGE = 60 (constant)
4. Comparison chart: Traditional charity vs AI-enforced allocation
5. Trust metrics: Transparency, Immutability, Verifiability

**ON SCREEN:**
- Screen recording: Full checkout flow

**NARRATOR:**
"Step 1: You subscribe to an AI service on aidoesitall.website. Let's say you pay $100 per month.

You enter your payment details. We use Stripe for processing. Enterprise-grade security. PCI compliant.

You click Subscribe. Stripe processes the payment. Charges your card. Sends a confirmation.

But here's where we're different. The moment Stripe confirms your payment, a webhook hits our backend API.

That webhook contains your transaction data. Amount. Timestamp. Transaction ID.

Our backend receives the webhook. Logs it. And immediately calculates the Gospel V1.3 split."

## MAIN POINT #2: The Split (1:40-2:50)

**ON SCREEN:**
- Code walkthrough: Split calculation function

**NARRATOR:**
"Step 2: The backend calculates the split. Here's the actual code.

Your $100 payment is passed to the allocation function.

Line 1: Calculate 60% for Verified Pediatric Charities. That's $60.

Line 2: Calculate 30% for infrastructure. That's $30.

Line 3: Calculate 10% for founder. That's $10.

These aren't estimates. These are exact calculations. Rounded to the nearest cent.

The function logs all three allocations to PostgreSQL. Each allocation gets:
- A unique transaction ID
- A timestamp (exact second)
- The allocation amount
- The Gospel version (V1.3)
- The charity wallet address
- The transaction source

This entire process takes 200 milliseconds. Faster than you can blink.

And it's automatic. No human reviews it. No approval process. The code just executes the Gospel."

**ON SCREEN:**
1. api/server.js - allocateProfits() function
2. Code walkthrough with line-by-line annotations:
   ```javascript
   const charityShare = totalAmount * 0.60;  // $60

## MAIN POINT #3: The Blockchain Record (2:50-4:00)

**ON SCREEN:**
- BaseScan interface walkthrough

**NARRATOR:**
"Step 3: The blockchain record. This is where it gets permanent.

Our backend triggers a smart contract function on Base blockchain. (Planned for Q1 2026 - currently backend enforcement)

The contract receives:
- Your transaction ID
- The 60/30/10 split amounts
- A timestamp
- The charity wallet address

The contract executes. Records the allocation on-chain. Returns a transaction hash.

That transaction hash is immutable. Permanent. Anyone can verify it.

Here's what you see on BaseScan:

Your transaction ID. The exact timestamp. The 60% allocation to charity wallet. The 30% to infrastructure wallet. The 10% to founder wallet.

All of it public. All of it verifiable. All of it permanent.

No one can delete this record. No one can modify it. Not me. Not the board. Not even the blockchain itself.

This is zero-trust transparency. You don't have to believe us. You can verify it yourself."
