**60/30/10 Message:** Supporters create content showing why they believe 60% to verified pediatric charities changes everything.

## 1. UGC CAMPAIGN CONCEPTS

**Content Prompts:**
- "Here's why I support a platform that gives 60% to kids instead of 10%..."
- "Most platforms keep 90%. FOR THE KIDS gives 60% to verified pediatric charities. That's the difference."
- "I switched from [competitor] because 60% > 10%. Simple math. Big impact."

**Success Metrics:**
- 500+ posts in first month
- 10,000+ hashtag impressions

```

FOR THE KIDS WAY:
12 months × $100/month = $1,200
60% to charity = $720 to kids

## 12. QUALITY GUIDELINES

### What Makes Good UGC?

**Pillar 1: Authenticity**

**Good:**
- Personal story with specific details
- Genuine emotion (joy, gratitude, frustration with old way)
- Conversational tone
- Imperfect but real

**Bad:**
- Generic praise ("This is great!")
- Copy-pasted template language
- Overly promotional tone
- Too polished (looks like ad)

**Example - Good:**
```
"My daughter needed PT after her accident. The charity that helped us only gets 15% from most platforms. When I found FOR THE KIDS gives 60%, I switched everything. That extra 45% could be another kid's therapy. It matters."
```

**Example - Bad:**
```
"FOR THE KIDS is the best platform! Everyone should use it! Amazing! 5 stars!"
```

---

**Pillar 2: Message Clarity**

**Good:**
- Clearly explains 60/30/10 split
- Compares to industry standard
- Specific impact example
- Easy to understand

**Bad:**
- Vague about what FOR THE KIDS does
- Confusing numbers/percentages
- No context for why it matters
- Jargon-heavy

**Example - Good:**
```
"Most platforms: 10-20% to charity
FOR THE KIDS: 60% to charity

If I spend $100:
Old way = $10-20 to kids
New way = $60 to kids

Same spending. 3-6x more impact. That's why I'm here."
```

**Example - Bad:**
```
"FOR THE KIDS has great blockchain technology and transparent methodologies for charitable disbursement optimization."
```

---

**Pillar 3: Visual Appeal**

**Good:**
- Well-lit photo/video
- Subject in focus
- Clean background (not distracting)
- Appropriate framing
- High resolution

**Bad:**
- Blurry/pixelated
- Poor lighting (can't see subject)
- Busy/distracting background
- Cropped awkwardly
- Low resolution

**Photo Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Can you clearly see the subject?
- [ ] Is the lighting sufficient?
- [ ] Is the focus sharp?
- [ ] Is the composition balanced?
- [ ] Would you stop scrolling to look at this?

---

**Pillar 4: Emotion & Story**

**Good:**
- Evokes feeling (inspiration, hope, gratitude)
- Tells a story (beginning, middle, end)
- Personal connection evident
- Relatable to others

**Bad:**
- Flat, emotionless statement
- No story arc
- Can't connect with creator's motivation
- Too abstract

**Story Structure:**
```
1. Hook: What got your attention about FOR THE KIDS?
2. Problem: What frustrated you about old way of giving?
3. Solution: How does FOR THE KIDS solve that?
4. Impact: What difference does it make?
5. Call to Action: What should others do?
```

---

**Pillar 5: Shareability**

**Good:**
- Short enough to consume quickly (60-90sec video, 100-300 word text)
- Makes you want to tell others
- Includes surprising fact or stat
- Easy to understand without context
- Clear CTA

**Bad:**
- Too long (loses attention)
- Requires prior knowledge to understand
- No reason to share with others
- No clear next step

**Shareability Test:**
- Would you send this to a friend?
