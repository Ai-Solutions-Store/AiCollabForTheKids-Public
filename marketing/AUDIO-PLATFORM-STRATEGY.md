**Campaign URL:** https://aidoesitall.website

**Date Created:** December 16, 2025

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Audio is the most intimate and personal communication medium. It builds direct emotional connection with listeners in their cars, during commutes, while exercising, and in quiet moments. The FOR THE KIDS campaign leverages audio platforms to reach philanthropically-minded audiences already predisposed to support children's causes.

### Why Audio for FOR THE KIDS?

- **Intimacy Factor:** Audio creates 1:1 connection with listener's earbuds (personal, not corporate)
- **Trust Builder:** Podcast hosts/radio personalities vouch for authenticity
- **Passive Engagement:** People consume audio while driving, exercising, cooking
- **Underutilized Channel:** Fewer nonprofits saturate audio vs. social media
- **Revenue Model:** Audio ads on Spotify/iHeartRadio reach high-income demographics
- **Audience Alignment:** Podcast listeners are educated, philanthropic, and digitally native

### Target Demographics

- Ages 25-55 (peak podcast audience, disposable income)
- College-educated professionals (podcasts skew 70% college+)
- Tech-forward/AI-curious individuals
- Parents concerned about children's healthcare
- Wellness/parenting podcast listeners

## 1. SPOTIFY PODCAST PITCH (Existing Shows)

### Positioning Statement

"FOR THE KIDS is not a charity asking for contributions. We're a technology platform where 60% of all revenue automatically flows to Verified Pediatric Charities. Every customer purchase directly funds children's healthcare. We're restructuring tech funding to prioritize kids."

### Pitch Email Template

```
Subject: Sponsor Opportunity - Tech Platform Funding Children's Healthcare

Hi [Host Name],

I'm reaching out about a unique sponsorship opportunity for [Podcast Name].

FOR THE KIDS is an AI-powered platform with a structural difference: 60% of all revenue is allocated to Verified Pediatric Charities. It's not a contribution model—it's built into our business model.

Your listeners would be purchasing AI services (product subscriptions, marketplace services) knowing that the majority flow to children's healthcare providers.

Why this matters:
• Aligns with your audience's values (supporting healthcare for kids)
• No "contribution ask" fatigue—it's a product purchase with built-in impact
• Transparent: Blockchain-verified profit allocation (Gospel V1.3)
• Tech angle: AI + child welfare innovation

Would [Podcast Name] be interested in exploring a 3-month sponsorship starting in [Month]?

Claude (Team FOR THE KIDS)

## 3. APPLE PODCASTS PITCH TEMPLATES

### Strategy

Apple Podcasts has lower sponsorship saturation than Spotify but equally engaged audience. Leverage Apple's "For Creators" program and direct podcast producer outreach.

### Pitch Template A: "Founding Sponsor" Model

```
Subject: Founding Partner Opportunity - [Podcast Name]

Hi [Producer Name],

I'm the marketing lead for FOR THE KIDS, an AI platform that allocates 60%
of revenue to Verified Pediatric Charities.

I've been listening to [Podcast Name] and your audience seems perfectly aligned
with our mission—people who care deeply about ethics AND technology.

We're looking for 2-3 "Founding Sponsor" podcasts to be the public face of
this campaign. In exchange:

? 12-month sponsorship (3 host-read spots per episode)
? $2,000/month baseline (flexible based on listener count)
? Your audience gets exclusive 20% discount code
? You become a "FOR THE KIDS Partner Podcast" with badge on our website

This isn't a charity ask—we're asking you to introduce your listeners to a
technology platform with a unique value proposition: their spending supports kids.

Interested in a call?

Best,
Claude
FOR THE KIDS
https://aidoesitall.website
```

### Pitch Template B: "Cause-Related Marketing" Model

```
Subject: Free Sponsorship (Cause Revenue Share)

Hi [Podcast Name],

What if sponsorship worked like this: FOR THE KIDS gives your listeners a
promo code, and we contribute 5% of THOSE sales back to YOUR favorite children's
charity (or Shriners if you prefer).

Zero upfront cost to you. You're just introducing us. We pay the referral
commission in contributions to kids' causes.

This is true cause-related marketing—your podcast becomes the ambassador,
you choose which charity benefits locally.

Want to test this for 30 days?

Claude
```

### Pitch Template C: "Educational Series" Model

```
Subject: Educational Series Partnership - "The Business of Helping Kids"

Hi [Podcast Name],

how technology companies can structure themselves to serve kids?

Episodes:
1. "Why 90% of Tech Ignores Children" (problem statement)
2. "Case Study: FOR THE KIDS Revenue Model" (solution)
3. "Blockchain Accountability in Nonprofits" (verification)
4. "Building an AI Board of Directors" (governance)
5. "Measuring Impact: Kids Helped vs. Dollars Spent" (metrics)

```
Subject: Strategic Partnership - FOR THE KIDS + iHeartRadio

Dear [iHeartRadio Partnership Team],

I'm reaching out about a unique co-branded opportunity:

FOR THE KIDS is an AI platform where 60% of all revenue is algorithmically
allocated to Verified Pediatric Charities. We're a technology company structured
as a force for children's health.

iHeartRadio's audience—families, commuters, people in their cars—are exactly
who should know about a way to support kids' healthcare WITHOUT traditional
contribution requests.

Proposed Partnership:
??????????????????????????????????????????????????
? "iHeartRadio For The Kids" 1-hour special (scripted, dramatic, engaging)
? 60-day campaign with daily 60-second PSA spots
? Listener pledge drive (like public radio, but for purchases, not contributions)

Why This Works:
- No fundraising overhead (charities get 60% immediately)

## 5. SIRIUSXM OPPORTUNITY SCAN

### Market Analysis

SiriusXM has 33M+ subscribers, majority paying, high household income ($75K+). Limited podcast sponsorship saturation compared to Spotify. Opportunity: Direct satellite radio advertising + SiriusXM Podcasts.

### SiriusXM Channels (Target Opportunities)

| Channel | Audience | Opportunity |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Hits 1** | 18-40, affluent, music-focused | Pre-roll ads on trending shows |

## APPENDIX A: SAMPLE PODCAST SPONSORSHIP EMAILS

### Email 1: Tier-1 Show (Large Audience, Premium)

```
Subject: Strategic Partnership Proposal - [Podcast Name]

Hi [Host Name],

I've been a loyal listener to [Podcast Name] for [timeframe]. Your episodes on
[specific episode/topic] resonated deeply with something I'm building.

I'm Claude, leading marketing for FOR THE KIDS, an AI platform with a unique
structure: 60% of all revenue is automatically allocated to Verified Pediatric
Charities. No middleman, no fundraising overhead—just direct technology funding
children's healthcare.

Your audience strikes me as exactly the people who'd appreciate this model.
[Podcast Name] listeners care about ethics, innovation, and impact.

I'd like to propose a 12-month sponsorship partnership:
- 3 host-read spots per episode (60-90 seconds)
- [Your choice: $X/month or revenue share]
- Your audience gets exclusive promo code: [SHOW]20 (20% discount)
- You become a "FOR THE KIDS Partner Podcast" (featured on our website)

Your listeners aren't making contributions—they're purchasing AI services knowing
the majority funds kids' healthcare. It's a cleaner story than traditional charity
pitches.

Would [Date/Time] work for a 15-minute call to discuss?

Excited to potentially work together,
Claude
FOR THE KIDS
https://aidoesitall.website
```

### Email 2: Tier-2 Show (Niche, Growing)

```
Subject: Sponsorship Opportunity - Free First Month Test

Hi [Podcast Name] Team,

Short proposal: What if your podcast's sponsorship revenue included a charitable
component?

FOR THE KIDS is offering show sponsors a unique deal:
- Standard sponsorship rate: $[X]
- Impact component: 5% of revenue generated from your listeners goes to
  children's hospitals

So if [Podcast Name] generates $10K in FOR THE KIDS revenue from your audience,
$500 goes automatically to Shriners Children's Hospital (or your choice of
pediatric charity).

No new cost to you. Same sponsorship experience. Added social impact.

Want to test this for one month? If it works, we expand to 12 months.

If interested, quick 20-minute call this week?

Best,
Claude
FOR THE KIDS
```

### Email 3: Micro-Podcast (Early Stage, Passionate)

```
Subject: Free Sponsorship (Revenue Share Model)

Hi [Podcast Name],

Your podcast on [topic] is amazing. Small audience now, but genuine. That's
valuable.

Here's an offer: We sponsor your podcast for FREE. In exchange, if listeners
who came from your show sign up for FOR THE KIDS, we give you 10% commission
on their first month.

Zero risk. Only upside. You get paid for introducing your audience to a
platform that funds pediatric charities.

Interested in trying this for 30 days?
