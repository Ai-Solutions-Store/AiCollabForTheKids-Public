## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

**If blog isn't done by Monday 2pm:**
- Don't delay week. Publish Tuesday morning instead
- Move all other content distribution back 1 day
- Repurpose happens same schedule, just shifted

**If you can't record video Wednesday:**
- Use blog images + text overlays in CapCut instead (takes 2 hours)
- Create video for next Thursday (publish following Friday)
- Don't skip video—just delay 1 week

**If podcast audio quality is poor:**
- Re-record just the problematic sections (usually 5-10 min)
- Audacity will stitch together automatically
- Increase mic distance + reduce volume 2dB

**If email not reaching subscribers:**
- Check spam folder (might be filtered)
- Verify email addresses are correct in ConvertKit
- Send test to yourself first
- Check email preview in Buffer before scheduling

**If social posts not getting engagement:**
- Timing might be off (change posting time by 2 hours)
- Content might not resonate (note for next week)
- CTAs might be weak (test different CTA next post)
- Hashtags might be wrong (use trending hashtags)
