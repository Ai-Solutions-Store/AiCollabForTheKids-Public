## KEY TALKING POINTS (ALL PARTNERS)

### The Mission:
> "We allocate 60% of all revenue to verified pediatric charities. It's hardcoded in a smart contract�literally cannot be changed."

### The Platform:
> "ai-solutions.store sells AI-powered business tools. Customers bring their own API keys (BYOK model), so we have near-zero costs and 95%+ margins flow to charity."

### Year 1 Impact:
> "Projected $1.2M revenue = $720K to children's hospitals = our mission to help children in our first year alone."

### Why Trust Us:
> "Blockchain-verified transparency dashboard. Claude AI-generated codebase. Smart contract on Base Mainnet. Public ledger of every transaction."

### The Differentiator:
> "This isn't charity marketing�it's our business model. No competitor allocates 60% of revenue to children's healthcare."

Before sending ANY email, fill in:

- [ ] `[CONTACT NAME]` � First name (LinkedIn/website research)
- [ ] `[COMPANY/HOSPITAL/BUSINESS NAME]` � Exact official name
- [ ] `[SPECIFIC OBSERVATION]` � Recent news, product launch, or initiative
- [ ] `[RELEVANT DETAIL]` � Their focus area (pediatric oncology, AI tools, etc.)

---

## FOLLOW-UP CADENCE

| Timeline | Action | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Day 0** | Send initial email | Introduction + value prop |
| **Day 5-7** | First follow-up | Gentle nudge ("Did this get buried?") |
| **Day 14** | Second follow-up | Value-add (attach one-pager, case study) |
| **Day 30** | Final follow-up | Permission to close file ("Should I stop?") |

**After Day 30:** Move to "nurture" list (quarterly updates on platform growth/impact).

---

## RESPONSE SCRIPTS (COPY/PASTE)

### "Not interested"
> "Totally understand�thanks for the quick response! If anything changes or you know someone in [RELEVANT DEPARTMENT], feel free to pass this along. Either way, appreciate your time."

### "Send more info"
> "Absolutely�attaching our one-pager. Key highlights: $1.2M Year 1 revenue, 60% = $720K to charity, blockchain-verified transparency. Happy to hop on a call to answer questions, or feel free to explore aidoesitall.website. What works better for you?"

### "What's the catch?"
> "Ha�fair question! No catch. Our model is simple: we sell software, customers bring their own AI API keys (so we have near-zero costs), and 60% of revenue is hardcoded into a smart contract to go to verified pediatric charities. It's a for-profit LLC with allocated beneficiaries, not a charity soliciting contributions. Think of it like TOMS Shoes, but for B2B software."

### "We already have a charity partner"
> "That's awesome�who do you partner with? (Always good to learn from others.) FOR THE KIDS isn't asking to replace your current giving; we're offering a way to turn operational spend (software purchases) into additional charitable impact. Different budget, different mechanism. But if the timing isn't right, totally understand."

### "Can we get a discount?"
> "We don't discount (because that reduces the 60% to charity), but we do offer extended trials and flexible payment terms for annual contracts. Would a 90-day pilot at full price work, with the option to expand if your team finds value?"

## EMAIL BEST PRACTICES

### DO:
- ? Front-load value (first 2 sentences = what's in it for them)
- ? Use numbers ($720K, 60%, 360 children)
- ? Include social proof (Claude AI, blockchain, Base Mainnet)
- ? Single clear CTA (one ask per email)
- ? Suggest specific meeting times (removes friction)

### DON'T:
- ? Apologize for reaching out ("Sorry to bother you")
- ? Use walls of text (bullets and bold for scannability)
- ? Multiple CTAs ("Call me OR email me OR visit the site OR...")
- ? Generic language ("We're a great company looking to partner")
- ? Violate Gospel V1.3 (NEVER say "60%", "contribute", "treasury")

---

## GOSPEL V1.3 COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

Every email MUST:
- [ ] Say "60% of revenue" (NEVER "60%")

- [ ] Mention "verified pediatric charities" (specificity = trust)
- [ ] Reference transparency mechanism (blockchain, dashboard, smart contract)
- [ ] Include "FOR THE KIDS" in signature or PS

Every email MUST NOT:
- [ ] Use contribution language (violates Corporate Sovereign model)
- [ ] Reference Gospel V1.3 or older (we're on V1.3)
- [ ] Mention 60/30/10 split (outdated�now 60/30/10)
- [ ] Use "founder gets 20%" (outdated�now 10%)

---
