## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Cyclists are the most charitable athletes in the world. They ride for causes. Every cycling community—from casual bike commuters to professional racers—shares a common purpose: forward momentum. FOR THE KIDS transforms that momentum into impact. This strategy creates a comprehensive partnership ecosystem that leverages cycling's grassroots community to drive awareness and revenue for pediatric care. Every mile pedaled, every charity ride organized, every bike shop engaged becomes a touchpoint for children's health.

**Key Insight:** Cyclists ride for causes. Position FOR THE KIDS as the cause that every cyclist already wants to support. Make pedaling for kids effortless and visible.

Cyclists ride for causes. FOR THE KIDS is the cause that every cyclist wants to support. This strategy transforms the cycling community—from professional racers to weekend riders to spin class enthusiasts—into a movement where pedaling for kids becomes as natural as clipping into pedals.

Every mile ridden, every bike shop visited, every charity ride organized, every class completed becomes a touchpoint for pediatric care. The cycling community is massive, passionate, and generous. By the end of 2026, cycling culture will know: FOR THE KIDS is where wheels turn into wellness for children.

**Cyclists pedal for causes. FOR THE KIDS is the cause they were waiting for.**
