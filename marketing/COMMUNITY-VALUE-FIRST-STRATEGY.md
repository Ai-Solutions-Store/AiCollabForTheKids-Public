# FOR THE KIDS - Value-First Community Engagement Strategy

**Mission:** 60% of revenue to Verified Pediatric Charities (Gospel V1.3)
**Campaign URL:** https://aidoesitall.website
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-17

## CORE PHILOSOPHY: VALUE BEFORE ASKS

**The Golden Rule:** If you can't answer "What value is this person getting from my message?" then don't post it.

Not every community post needs to sell anything. In fact, most shouldn't. The best community engagement creates trust through relentless value delivery, then mission becomes the natural byproduct.

---

## THE 80/20/10 FRAMEWORK

**For every 10 messages in a community:**
- **8 messages = Pure value** (no mention of FOR THE KIDS, no pitch)
- **2 messages = Mission-focused** (mention charity, Gospel V1.3, campaign URL)
- **1 message = Soft ask** (encourage exploration of platform)

This ratio builds trust. By the time you ask, the community already believes you're here to help.

## VALUE-FIRST TACTICS BY COMMUNITY TYPE

### EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM COMMUNITIES

**Value Delivery (8 messages):**
1. **Share analysis:** "I analyzed 50 pediatric charity funding models - here's what works best" (no mention of your platform)
2. **Answer questions:** "How do you measure impact in pediatric research?" (expert response)
3. **Highlight others:** "Check out what St. Jude is doing with X..." (pure recommendation)
4. **Share research:** "Data on cost-per-life-saved in different pediatric interventions" (educational)
5. **Discuss trade-offs:** "Why 60% to mission isn't always optimal (when it isn't)" (honest critique)
6. **Answer methodologies:** "Here's how we calculate cost-effectiveness for our charity partners" (transparency)
7. **Host office hours:** "I'm available to discuss social enterprise model design" (free advice)
8. **Share failures:** "We tried X for charity allocation, it didn't work, here's why" (learning from mistakes)

**Mission Message (2 messages):**
- "Given the frameworks we've discussed, here's how FOR THE KIDS implements them"
- "Our Gospel V1.3 is essentially applied effective altruism - here's the reasoning"

**Soft Ask (1 message):**
- "If any of this resonates, we'd love your feedback on our actual model"

**Success Metric:** EA community members understand cost-per-impact better because of your insights. THEN they evaluate FOR THE KIDS through that lens.

### INDIE HACKERS / FOUNDER COMMUNITIES

**Value Delivery (8 messages):**
1. **Share metrics:** "Here's my honest revenue breakdown (including what we give away)" - normalizes transparency
2. **Discuss challenges:** "Building a company where growth literally = charity growth is hard. Here's why"
3. **Answer founder questions:** Respond helpfully to founder struggles (without pitching)
4. **Share operational playbooks:** "Here's how we structure our charity allocation partnerships"

**Soft Ask (1 message):**
- "Check us out if this approach interests you, and let me know what you'd do differently"

**Success Metric:** Founders respect your business acumen. They're skeptical of the charity part. When you finally mention it, they evaluate honestly instead of dismissing.

**Soft Ask (1 message):**

7. **Ask for advice:** "What would you do in this parenting situation?" (show vulnerability)
8. **Share honest failures:** "Tried X parenting approach, failed spectacularly, here's what I learned"

**Mission Message (2 messages):**

**Soft Ask (1 message):**

## SPECIFIC VALUE PLAYS BY PROBLEM TYPE

### When Community Member Asks: "How do I [solve problem]?"

**Wrong Response:** "Use our platform!"

**Right Response:**
1. Answer their specific question thoroughly
2. Share the framework you used
3. Mention tools/approaches (may or may not include yours)
4. Ask clarifying questions about their situation
5. Optional: "If you want to explore our specific approach, DM me"

**Why This Works:** You've solved their immediate problem. If they later use your platform, it's because it's best fit - not because you pushed it.

---

### When Someone Criticizes Social Impact Models

**Wrong Response:** "That's wrong, here's why..."

**Right Response:**
1. "You're touching on a real challenge"
2. "Here's how we think about that concern..."
3. "You might be right that X is better than Y..."
4. "What would make a social impact model trustworthy to you?"

**Why This Works:** You're engaging with skepticism as valid. This builds more credibility than dismissing it. The skeptic might become your best evangelist if you handle it right.

---

### When Someone Shares a Compliment

**Wrong Response:** "Thanks! Have you tried our platform?"

**Right Response:**
1. "Thank you, that means a lot"
2. "This is exactly why we built FOR THE KIDS"
3. "If you ever want to discuss further, I'm around"
4. Continue helping in community

**Why This Works:** You acknowledge the compliment, connect to mission, but don't extract value. They'll explore organically.

---

## HANDLING THE GOSPEL V1.3 CONVERSATION

**When someone asks: "Is the 60% real or just marketing?"**

**Excellent Response:**
"That's the question to ask. Here's how you verify:
- Email any of our charity partners and ask if they receive payments
- We publish monthly allocation breakdowns
- We're implementing blockchain verification for immutable audit trail
- We welcome outside audits

The whole point is: don't trust us, verify us."

**Why This Works:** You're not defensive. You're inviting verification. This builds more trust than claims alone.

---

## METRICS THAT MATTER

**Track These for Each Community:**

1. **Engagement Quality** (not just quantity)
   - Thoughtful responses per post
   - Follow-up questions asked
   - Community members tagging you in discussions

2. **Credibility Signals**
   - "Thanks, this was helpful" type responses
   - Community members citing your insights
   - DMs asking for advice

3. **Gospel Conversion**
   - When you mention 60%, how does community respond?
   - Are there objections or acceptance?
   - Do people ask follow-up questions?

4. **Business Impact**
   - Campaign URL clicks from community
   - Signups mentioning community name in origin source
   - Partnerships formed from community connections
   - Customer testimonials from community members

5. **Evangelist Growth**
   - Community members mentioning FOR THE KIDS unprompted
   - How many community members are repeating your talking points?
   - Referrals from community members

---

## RED FLAGS: When Value-First Isn't Working

**If after 8 weeks:**
- You're still not getting engagement
- Community feels cold to your input
- No one is asking follow-up questions
- Community rules explicitly ban your work type

**Action:** Pivot communities. Different communities have different cultures.

---

## GOLDEN RULES

1. **Value must be real** - Not "value-ish" or "tangentially helpful." Actually useful.

2. **Gospel V1.3 must be earned** - You don't mention 60% until you've proven you deserve attention.

3. **Responses matter more than posts** - One thoughtful response = 10 generic posts. Go deep.

4. **Community comes first** - You're joining THEIR house, not promoting yours. Respect that.

5. **Authenticity wins** - Fake enthusiasm gets detected. Real passion gets shared.

6. **Slow growth beats fast burn** - Better to have 20 true advocates than 200 skeptics.

7. **Listen 2x more than you speak** - Ask questions, learn what community actually needs.

8. **Gospel compliance is automatic when you've built trust** - When they know you, 60% is interesting. When they don't, it's suspicious.

---

## FINAL WORD: Why Value-First Wins

Communities are tired of being sold to. They're sophisticated enough to detect pitches from a mile away. But they're hungry for genuine expertise, authentic community, and people who care about their success.

If you consistently provide value without asking for anything, the community eventually wants to help you succeed. That's when they buy from you. That's when they evangelize for you. That's when Gospel V1.3 becomes their belief, not just your policy.

**The math:**
- 100 spammy pitches = 2 conversions (and community bans you)
- 100 value-first contributions = 15 conversions (and community advocates for you)

Be the second type.

**FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS.**
**Gospel V1.3: 60% to Charity, 30% to Infrastructure, 10% to Founder**
