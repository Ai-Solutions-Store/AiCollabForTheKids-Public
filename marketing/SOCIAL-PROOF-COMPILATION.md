# From Idea to Impact: How 5,000 Backers Funded a Pediatric Cancer Unit

## Before FOR THE KIDS

St. Jude Children's Research Hospital needed to expand their outpatient infusion center.

100 children were waiting 3+ hours for chemotherapy.
Parents were sleeping in waiting rooms.
Nurses were overwhelmed.

They needed $50,000 to add 4 new infusion bays.

Traditional fundraising timeline: 12-18 months.

## The FOR THE KIDS Community Stepped Up

**Timeframe:** 60 days
**Backers Involved:** 5,234
**Total contributed:** $52,400 (60% of platform revenue)
**Blockchain Transaction:** [Link to verified transaction]

5,234 people backed FOR THE KIDS.
Many didn't even know this specific project existed.
But their commitment to the 60% charity pledge made it happen.

## After: Real Kids, Real Impact

**90 Days Later:**
? 4 new infusion bays installed
? Wait times reduced from 3 hours to 45 minutes
? 100+ children treated more comfortably
? Families have private spaces
? Nurses report 40% reduction in stress

### In Their Own Words

**Dr. Sarah Martinez, Pediatric Oncologist:**
> "I've been at St. Jude for 15 years. I've never seen a project funded this quickly
> or this transparently. Knowing that 5,000 people we've never met cared enough to
> make this happen... it's overwhelming. Thank you."

**Jennifer Torres, Mother of Patient:**
> "My daughter Sophia gets chemo every week. Before, we'd wait 3+ hours in a crowded
> waiting room. She was already exhausted. Now? We have a private bay, it's quiet,
> and we wait 30 minutes max. This changed our lives."

**Sophia Torres, Age 9:**
> "I like the new room. It has a window and I can see the birds. Thank you to everyone
> who helped make it."

1. Music therapy program ($30,000)
2. Family lodging expansion ($75,000)
