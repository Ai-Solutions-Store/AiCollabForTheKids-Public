## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The FOR THE KIDS campaign transcends religious boundaries with a simple, universal message: **Children's health is sacred across all faiths.** This document provides faith communities with resources to share our mission with their congregations through biblically-sound, theologically-aligned, and spiritually-motivated outreach.

**The Core Truth:** When a child at a Children's Hospital receives treatment, nobody asks their faith. We don't either. We serve all children, supported by all faiths.

**Body:**

"Jesus said, 'Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.' (Matthew 19:14)

A new technology platform is embodying this call: **FOR THE KIDS** (aidoesitall.website) commits **60% of all revenue directly to Children's Hospitals** providing life-saving care to sick children.

*'Whatever you did for the least of these, you did for me.' (Matthew 25:31-46)*

### TEMPLATE B: JEWISH - "Tikkun Olam" (Repairing the World)

**Headline:** Tikkun Olam: Healing the World Through Technology

**Body:**

"In Jewish tradition, we speak of **Tikkun Olam—repairing the world** through justice and compassion. The FOR THE KIDS platform embodies this sacred obligation.

**60% of revenue goes directly to Children's Hospitals.** Not someday. Not after expenses. Structurally guaranteed.

In our tradition, we ask: 'Who is rich? One who gives to the poor.' The FOR THE KIDS model places children's healing at the center of commerce itself.

**How to engage:**
- Learn about the campaign: https://aidoesitall.website
- Use the platform for technology needs
- Teach children about ethical commerce
- Connect with your synagogue's social action committee

*The righteous know the soul of the hungry.* (Proverbs 29:7)

### TEMPLATE C: ISLAMIC - "Sadaqah & Zakat" (Charitable Giving)

**Headline:** Sadaqah Jariyah: Continuous Giving for Healing

**Body:**

"In Islam, we understand **Sadaqah Jariyah—continuous giving that benefits others long after the giver.** The FOR THE KIDS platform makes this possible through commerce itself.

**60% of platform revenue flows directly to children's hospitals.** This is not a contribution request. This is a structural commitment embedded in how the business operates.

The platform allows any believer to:
- Fulfill your **Zakat** obligation (2.5% of wealth to the poor)
- Perform **Sadaqah** (voluntary charity)
- Practice **Amanah** (trustworthiness in commerce)
- Benefit from **Halal business practices**

**Every transaction helps children in need:**
- Hospital treatment for critically ill children
- Pediatric surgical care
- Emergency medical response

**How to participate:**
- Visit: https://aidoesitall.website
- Use the platform knowing 60% supports verified children's hospitals
- Share with your Ummah
- Connect with Masjid community outreach programs

*The best charity is given to those most in need, and Allah does not waste the reward of those who do good.* (Quran 9:60)

*And establish prayer and give Zakat and obey the Messenger...* (Quran 24:56)

---

### TEMPLATE D: BUDDHIST - "Karuna in Action" (Compassion)

**Headline:** Karuna and Commerce: Compassion in Every Transaction

**Body:**

"The Buddha taught that **Karuna—compassion—is the highest spiritual practice.** The FOR THE KIDS platform demonstrates that commerce can be sacred.

**60% of revenue supports children's hospitals.** This is structural compassion, not occasional kindness.

In the Four Immeasurables, we cultivate:
- **Metta** (loving-kindness toward all)
- **Karuna** (compassion for suffering)
- **Mudita** (joy in others' happiness)
- **Upekkha** (equanimity and action)

The FOR THE KIDS platform embodies all four.

**Why participate:**
- Help sick children receive life-saving treatment
- Support healthcare workers (modern Bodhisattvas)
- Build positive Karma through ethical commerce
- Model Engaged Buddhism—spirituality in action

**How to get involved:**
- Use the platform: https://aidoesitall.website
- Know that 60% supports verified children's hospitals
- Teach children about compassionate economics
- Join sangha conversations about ethical technology

*If you light a lamp for someone else, it will also brighten your own path.* (Buddhist saying)

Visit: https://aidoesitall.website"

---

### TEMPLATE E: GENERIC INTERFAITH - "One Mission, Many Faiths"

**Headline:** Across All Faiths: Healing for Children

**Body:**

"Children get sick. Nobody asks their faith at the hospital.

**FOR THE KIDS** (https://aidoesitall.website) applies this truth to business: **60% of revenue supports Children's Hospitals**, period.

**Christians** see Jesus's mandate to care for the vulnerable.
**Jewish leaders** understand this as Tikkun Olam.
**Muslims** recognize it as Sadaqah Jariyah.
**Buddhists** embrace it as Karuna in action.
**Hindus** live it as Seva.
**Sikhs** practice it as Sewa.

One mission. Many spiritual traditions. One outcome: **Children get treatment they need.**

**What makes this different:**
- No contributions required (you use the platform for real services)
- No overhead (60% is guaranteed to go directly to hospitals)
- No judgment (we serve all children, all faiths)
- No exceptions (the split is hardcoded, never changes)

**Your faith community can:**
- Learn about the campaign at https://aidoesitall.website
- Invite your congregation to use the platform
- Host conversations about ethical commerce
- Partner with us on community health initiatives

*A single act of kindness can change the world.* (Interfaith wisdom)

## SECTION 4: CHRISTIAN TECH COMMUNITY OUTREACH

### TARGET COMMUNITIES

**Evangelical Tech Workers:**
- Tech workers in churches with 1,000+ attendees
- Campus Crusade for Christ alumni networks
- InterVarsity Christian Fellowship groups
- Christian tech conference attendees

**Mainline Protestant Tech Leaders:**
- United Methodist, Presbyterian, ELCA Lutheran IT professionals

- Anglican/Episcopal tech communities
- Reformation heritage tech networks

**Catholic Tech Communities:**
- Legatus (Catholic business leaders)
- Saint Paul Society (Catholic tech executives)
- Catholic Schools Technology Association
- Opus Dei tech professionals

### MESSAGING ANGLES

**Angle 1: "Redemptive Technology"**

*The Problem:* Tech can exploit, track, and harm.
*The Solution:* FOR THE KIDS reverses this. Every transaction heals instead of harms.

**Talking Point:** "We spent 20 years building technology that makes money. What if we built technology that heals children? That's what FOR THE KIDS does. It's the future—profitable AND redemptive."

**Scripture:** "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters, since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are serving." (Colossians 3:23-24)

---

**Angle 2: "Gospel in Code"**

*The Innovation:* The FOR THE KIDS model hardcodes ethics into business logic.

**Talking Point:** "We don't pray that profit goes to charity. We built it into the algorithm. The Gospel isn't negotiable in church or code. This platform proves you can be profitable AND faithful."

**Scripture:** "Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts. And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him." (Colossians 3:16-17)

---

**Angle 3: "Tech for Good (Not Just Vibes)"**

*The Challenge:* Many tech "for good" platforms are vaporware or virtue-signal.
*The Commitment:* FOR THE KIDS has accountable, verified pediatric hospital partners.

**Talking Point:** "We get it. 'Tech for good' is cliché. That's why we made it boring. No celebrity endorsements. No viral campaigns. Just 60% of revenue going to verified children's hospitals. You can audit it. You can track it. You can trust it."

**Scripture:** "If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you." (James 1:5)

## SECTION 5: JEWISH CHARITY NETWORK CONNECTIONS

### KEY JEWISH GIVING FRAMEWORKS

**1. Tzedakah (Righteous Obligation)**

**Principle:** Tzedakah is not charity (voluntary) but Tzedakah (obligatory justice).

**Messaging for FOR THE KIDS:**
"This isn't asking you to give charity. This is showing you a business model built on Tzedakah. By using the platform, you fulfill the obligation structurally. No contribution required. Justice embedded."

**Maimonides' 8 Levels of Tzedakah:**
1. Most Holy: Helping someone become self-sufficient (platform creates tech jobs)
2. Giving without knowing giver/receiver (60% automatic split = anonymous)
3. Knowing receiver but not known by them (hospital knows help comes, not from whom)
4. Knowing giver but not known by receiver (direct split visibility)
5. Giving directly in person (optional, platform enables)
6. Giving before being asked (proactive business model)
7. Giving reluctantly (no requirement to use)
8. Least Holy: Giving after being asked (this is better than those who don't)

**FOR THE KIDS Position:** Levels 1-5, continuously.

---

**2. Tikkun Olam (Repairing the World)**

**Principle:** Jewish obligation to repair broken systems and advance justice.

**Messaging for FOR THE KIDS:**
"Healthcare is broken. Expensive. Inaccessible. FOR THE KIDS repairs it through commerce. Not through protests or complaints. Through building better business."

**Justice Dimensions:**
- **Economic Justice:** Fair pricing, no exploitation
- **Health Justice:** Sick children regardless of wealth receive care
- **Systemic Change:** Proving that profit can align with healing
- **Community Care:** Strengthening institutions that serve vulnerable

---

**3. Pikuach Nefesh (Saving a Life)**

**Principle:** Saving a life overrides nearly all other commandments.

**Messaging for FOR THE KIDS:**
"Pikuach Nefesh means if a child's life is in danger, we do whatever it takes. FOR THE KIDS makes this our business model. 60% of every transaction is literally Pikuach Nefesh in action."

**Jewish Law Application:**
- Can violate Shabbat to save a life
- Can use non-Kosher food in life-or-death situations
- All other laws are secondary to preserving life

**FOR THE KIDS alignment:** Healing children is the highest mitzvah.

## SECTION 6: ISLAMIC CHARITABLE GIVING (ZAKAT) ANGLE

### ZAKAT FRAMEWORK

**Definition:** Annual obligation to give 2.5% of accumulated wealth to the poor.

**5 Eligible Categories (Mustahiq):**
1. Al-Fuqara (the poor)
2. Al-Masakin (the needy)
3. Aamiliin Alayha (those who collect and manage it)
4. Al-Mu'allafatu Qulubuhum (those whose hearts are inclined to Islam)
5. Ar-Riqaab (ransoming captives) - interpreted as "the most vulnerable"

**Children in hospitals fall under:**
- **Al-Fuqara** (poor families facing catastrophic medical debt)
- **Ar-Riqaab** (children "captive" to illness needing rescue)

---

### ZAKAT COMPLIANCE FOR FOR THE KIDS

**Question:** Can 60% revenue allocation serve as Zakat?

**Answer:** No, but it enables Zakat structurally.

**For the User:**
- Using the platform generates wealth
- 2.5% of that wealth is Zakat obligation
- FOR THE KIDS ensures 60% of business revenue supports verified charities
- Customers can feel confident that 60% + their Zakat = comprehensive care

**For the Platform:**
- 60% is structural profit allocation (business model)
- Not a Zakat collection mechanism (that's done separately)
- But it proves profit doesn't require exploitation
- Shows Islamic economic principles in action

---

### SADAQAH JARIYAH (CONTINUOUS GIVING)

**Definition:** Charity whose benefit continues after the giver's death.

**Three Types of Sadaqah Jariyah:**
1. Knowledge that benefits others
2. Righteous child who prays for parent
3. **Continuous charity** (structured giving)

**FOR THE KIDS as Sadaqah Jariyah:**
- When you build with FOR THE KIDS, the benefit continues
- Children healed today → healthier adults tomorrow
- Healthier adults → stronger communities
- The 60% split continues indefinitely
- Your use of the platform creates Sadaqah Jariyah

**Hadith:** "When a person dies, his deeds come to an end except for three: a continuing charity, knowledge by which people benefit, and a righteous child who prays for him." (Muslim)

---

### HALAL BUSINESS PRINCIPLES

FOR THE KIDS aligns with Halal commerce:

1. **No exploitation** - Fair wages, ethical labor
2. **No riba (interest)** - Transparent pricing, no hidden fees
3. **No gharar (uncertainty)** - Clear 60/30/10 split
4. **Amanah (trustworthiness)** - Hardcoded, verified, auditable
5. **Maslaha (public welfare)** - Children's health prioritized

---

### ISLAMIC NETWORK MESSAGING

**For Imams:**

"As-salamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh.

I want to share an opportunity that aligns with our Islamic values of caring for the vulnerable and ethical commerce.

FOR THE KIDS is a technology platform that commits 60% of all revenue directly to children's hospitals. This is not a Zakat collection. This is a business model that proves profit can coexist with compassion.

Our community can:
1. Use the platform for technology needs
2. Know that 60% supports verified pediatric care
3. Fulfill Zakat on income generated through the platform
4. Model ethical commerce to our children

I'm inviting Islamic leaders to join an interfaith coalition. Would your masjid be interested in learning more?"

**For Zakat Committees:**

"The FOR THE KIDS platform doesn't replace Zakat. But it enables Zakat stewardship by ensuring that business wealth itself can be ethical.

When we recommend recipients, we can include verified pediatric hospitals knowing that 60% of platform revenue supports them. This strengthens our Zakat effectiveness."

---

## SECTION 7: BUDDHIST COMPASSION MESSAGING

### FOUR IMMEASURABLES

Buddhist practice centers on four unlimited states of mind:

**1. Metta (Loving-Kindness)**
- Wish for happiness of all beings
- No distinction between friend/enemy
- Children regardless of background = all beings

**FOR THE KIDS alignment:** 60% to any child in a verified pediatric hospital.

**2. Karuna (Compassion)**
- Wish for suffering to end
- Active response to pain
- Healing as spiritual practice

**FOR THE KIDS alignment:** Medical care ends children's suffering directly.

**3. Mudita (Sympathetic Joy)**
- Rejoicing in others' happiness
- Happiness multiplied when shared
- Celebrating healing together

**FOR THE KIDS alignment:** Every child's recovery is community cause for celebration.

**4. Upekkha (Equanimity)**
- Balance and inner peace
- Sustained compassion over time
- Wisdom to act rightly

**FOR THE KIDS alignment:** Structural commitment (not mood-dependent).

---

### BUDDHIST ECONOMIC ETHICS

**Right Livelihood (Samma-Ajiva)**

The Eightfold Path includes Right Livelihood:
- ✅ Avoid harming living beings
- ✅ Avoid selling addictive substances
- ✅ Avoid manufacturing weapons
- ✅ Avoid slavery or human trafficking
- ✅ Fair wages and ethical practices

**FOR THE KIDS position:** Exceeds Right Livelihood by *actively healing*.

**Engaged Buddhism**

Not just meditation—active participation in reducing suffering.

**Thich Nhat Hanh's Teaching:** "Please call me by my true names, so I can wake up...the frog singing after the rain, the child stricken with rickets, the arms merchant selling deadly weapons."

**FOR THE KIDS interpretation:** We can't ignore sick children in hospitals. We must respond actively.

---

### BUDDHIST OUTREACH MESSAGING

**For Sangha Leaders:**

"Our Buddhist practice calls us to Karuna—compassion in action. FOR THE KIDS is a secular platform using a Buddhist-aligned model: 60% of business revenue supports children's hospitals.

This isn't converting anyone to Buddhism. It's showing that the business world can embody Buddhist principles of non-harm and active compassion.

We invite your sangha to:
1. Learn about Engaged Buddhism in technology
2. Use the platform, knowing profits serve healing
3. Discuss ethical commerce in dharma study groups
4. Join an interfaith coalition of spiritual leaders

This is mindfulness applied to commerce."

**For Buddhist Teacher Networks:**

"The dharma teaches us that suffering is real and that we must respond. Children in hospitals represent real suffering. FOR THE KIDS is a response.

Consider sharing this platform with your students as an example of 'practicing Buddhism while earning a living.' It demonstrates that spiritual values can be embedded in business."

---

## SECTION 8: SERMON ILLUSTRATION TALKING POINTS

These are powerful sermon illustrations that reference FOR THE KIDS without requiring a commercial.

### ILLUSTRATION 1: "What Would Jesus Do With a Tech Platform?"

**Setup:** "I was thinking about a question: If Jesus were building a technology company in 2025, what would it look like?

He probably wouldn't have focus groups or venture capital. But He would have one absolute requirement: the platform must serve the vulnerable."

**Story:** "I recently learned about a platform called FOR THE KIDS. I'm not here to advertise. I'm here to tell you about a question it answers.

The developers asked: 'What if 60% of our profit went directly to children in hospitals? Not eventually. Not after expenses. Structurally. Built into the code.'

That's a Jesus question. And the answer is changing how we think about business."

**Application:** "Here's what struck me: We don't need more charities asking for contributions. We need more businesses asking, 'How do we serve the vulnerable structurally, not occasionally?'

That's not just good business. That's Gospel business."

**Scripture:** Matthew 25:31-46 (Whatever you did for the least of these...)

---

### ILLUSTRATION 2: "Children Have No Political Party"

**Setup:** "We're divided on a lot of things. Healthcare. Government. Taxes. But there's one thing we all agree on: sick children deserve help.

A child at [Local Children's Hospital] doesn't ask your politics. They just need treatment."

**Story:** "FOR THE KIDS is built on that simple agreement. It's a platform where Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, and secular neighbors all say yes to the same thing: Children first.

No ideology. No debate. Just: 'Let's ensure that 60% of our business revenue goes to pediatric hospitals.' Done."

**Application:** "What if we approached other issues this way? Not compromise. Not everyone winning. Just: 'Where can we all say yes?'

That's what FOR THE KIDS teaches us. That's also what Jesus teaches us about unity."

**Scripture:** Philippians 4:8-9 (Finally, brothers and sisters...)

---

### ILLUSTRATION 3: "The Parable of the Unjust Shopkeeper (Rewritten)"

**Setup:** "Jesus told a parable about an unjust shopkeeper who cut corners, exploited workers, and pocketed the profit. The point was clear: that's not how God's kingdom works.

But what about the reverse? A just shopkeeper?"

**Story:** "FOR THE KIDS is building the reverse parable. They said, 'What if we structured our business so that 60% of profit—automatically, unchangeably—goes to help children?'

No miraculous conversion. No tearful contribution speech. Just: 'This is how we do business here.'"

**Application:** "When we buy from a FOR THE KIDS vendor, we're not doing charity. We're participating in a business model where justice is embedded.

That's what the Parable of the Just Shopkeeper teaches us: righteousness isn't about rare individual acts. It's about structures that make right action the default."

**Scripture:** Amos 5:24 (Let justice roll on like a river...)

---

### ILLUSTRATION 4: "Tikkun Olam (Repairing the World)"

**Setup:** "In Jewish tradition, there's a concept called 'Tikkun Olam'—repairing the world. It means you can't just pray about injustice. You have to fix it.

Jesus taught the same principle differently. He healed. He fed. He repaired."

**Story:** "FOR THE KIDS is Tikkun Olam in action. Instead of repairing hospitals through contributions, they said, 'What if the business itself is the repair?'

60% of revenue to pediatric hospitals. Not asking. Not hoping. Structural."

**Application:** "Here's my question for us: Where are the broken places in our world that we're praying about but not fixing? Where could we embed justice into our structures instead of hoping for it occasionally?

FOR THE KIDS shows us it's possible. In business and in faith."

**Scripture:** James 1:22 (Do not merely listen to the word...do what it says.")

---

### ILLUSTRATION 5: "The Math of Compassion"

**Setup:** "Numbers matter. In Jesus's ministry, he fed 5,000. That's specific. He wasn't vague about compassion.

We shouldn't be either."

**Story:** "FOR THE KIDS has clear math: On average, $2,000 treats one child at a verified pediatric hospital. If 1,000 of us use this platform annually, that's 396+ children who receive treatment.

Not 'some help.' Not 'contributions toward care.' 396 children. Named. Specific. Real."

**Application:** "This matters because it proves compassion can be measured and scaled. It's not sentimental. It's mathematics applied to mercy.

Jesus taught us that numbers and names matter. 'One of these little ones' doesn't mean abstract. It means this child. By name. With care."

**Scripture:** Matthew 18:10-14 (The Parable of the Lost Sheep)

---

### ILLUSTRATION 6: "Gospel in Code"

**Setup:** "We talk about Gospel values. But what if the Gospel wasn't just in your heart, but in your code? Not just in your worship, but in your work?"

**Story:** "FOR THE KIDS hardcoded the Gospel. They literally built righteousness into their algorithm. 60% of profit—no exceptions, no negotiations—goes to children's hospitals.

It's not negotiable. It's not aspirational. It's law."

**Application:** "This is what we're called to do in our own work. Not be vague about our values. Build them in. Make them structural.

Whether you're a CEO, a teacher, a parent, or a technician—ask: 'How do I make my values the code I live by, not just the speech I give?'

That's what FOR THE KIDS teaches us. That's what the Gospel requires of us."

**Scripture:** John 3:36 (Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life...)

FOR THE KIDS is a technology platform that commits 60% of all revenue directly to verified pediatric hospitals—children's hospitals serving all kids regardless of background, faith, or ability to pay.

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**
In our tradition(s), we affirm that children's health is sacred. The FOR THE KIDS model embodies this principle structurally, not just aspirationally. When someone uses the platform, 60% of their payment goes to help a sick child. No exceptions. No negotiations.

We are forming a Faith Leaders Council that includes:

- Buddhist sangha leaders
- Hindu and Sikh leaders

We would be honored to include your voice and leadership.

A simple statement:

*"I [Name], [Title], endorse the FOR THE KIDS campaign. I believe that children's health is a sacred obligation across all faiths, and I support this model of ethical business that aligns profit with healing."*

You would:
- Be listed as a coalition member on materials
- Receive updates quarterly
- Be invited to annual summit (virtual or in-person)
- Help shape messaging for your faith community
- Share resources with your congregation/organization

This is an endorsement of mission, not a fundraising ask. No contributions required.

**TIMELINE:**
- We're forming the coalition now (December 2025)
- Public launch January 2026
- Media announcement planned for faith press and denominational publications

**NEXT STEP:**
Would you be willing to have a 20-minute conversation about this opportunity? I can share more details, answer questions, and discuss how your leadership could shape this initiative.

I'm attaching:

### FOLLOW-UP CALL SCRIPT (if leader agrees to conversation)

**Opening (1 min):**
"Thank you so much for taking time to talk about FOR THE KIDS. I know you're busy. This should take 20 minutes."

**Context (2 min):**
"The founder, Joshua Coleman, built this platform with one question: 'What if a business made helping sick children its core operating principle? Not charity. Not marketing. Structure.'

That's it. 60% of every transaction goes to pediatric hospitals."

**Your Role (3 min):**
"We're building a Faith Leaders Council because we believe children's health is a universal value. Your endorsement says: 'In our tradition/community, we affirm this mission.'

You wouldn't be doing fundraising. You'd be lending your name and wisdom to shape how we communicate with your community."

**Questions (5 min):**
"What questions do you have? What would make this more aligned with your community's values?"

(Listen. This is the key part. Their concerns shape how you move forward.)

**Commitment (3 min):**
"If you're interested, here's the next step: I'll send you the formal endorse template. You can modify it to match your voice. We'll announce the coalition in January 2026. Your community gets resources to share the mission."
