@levelsio - love what you've built with Nomad List & RemoteOK.

Building FOR THE KIDS: 60% of revenue → kids' hospitals (Gospel V1.3). No VC, no BS.

Bootstrapped like you. Thought your indie maker community would appreciate it.

Worth a look?
```

#### Personalized DM (Medium - Email/DM)
```
Hey Pieter,

I've been following your indie maker journey for years - Nomad List, RemoteOK, PhotoAI. Your bootstrap approach inspired a lot of us.

I built FOR THE KIDS (aidoesitall.website) with a similar ethos, but added something different: 60% of ALL revenue goes to verified pediatric charities. Not marketing, not eventually - it's in the founding documents (Gospel V1.3).

The split:
- 60% → Verified Pediatric Charities (Shriners, St. Jude, etc.)
- 30% → Infrastructure (servers, Stripe, etc.)
- 10% → Founder (me - I took less so kids get more)

I'm not asking for money. Just wondering if you'd consider sharing this with your indie maker community. They get building things with purpose.

If you're interested, I'd love to send you more details or hop on a quick call.

Either way - thanks for being an inspiration to indie builders everywhere.

Subject: FOR THE KIDS - Indie Maker Ethics Override

Hey Pieter,

I'm Josh Coleman, and I've been in the indie maker community for a while now. Your work - Nomad List, RemoteOK, PhotoAI - has been a masterclass in building profitable, bootstrapped businesses without selling your soul to VCs.

That's exactly the energy I brought to FOR THE KIDS (aidoesitall.website).

**What is FOR THE KIDS?**
An AI-powered marketplace for digital services and tools. But here's the twist: 60% of ALL revenue goes directly to verified pediatric charities. Not "profits." Not "after expenses." 60% of every dollar that comes in.

**The Split (Gospel V1.3):**
- 60% → Verified Pediatric Charities (Shriners, St. Jude, Boston Children's)
- 30% → Infrastructure (AWS, Stripe, developers)
- 10% → Founder compensation (me)

**Why I built it this way:**
Most founders take 20-60%. I took 10% because I wanted more to go to kids. It's called Gospel V1.3 - our "ethics override." Smart contracts will enforce it (Q1 2026 on Base blockchain). It's immutable.

**Why I'm reaching out to you:**
Your audience - indie makers, bootstrappers, people who care about building things that matter - would GET this. They understand that business doesn't have to be extractive. It can be generative.

**The Ask:**
Would you consider sharing FOR THE KIDS with your community? I'm not asking for an endorsement you don't believe in. Check it out first. If it resonates, share it. If not, no hard feelings.

I can offer:
- 20% affiliate commission on sales through your link
- Transparent dashboard to track conversions
- Co-created content (your voice, not mine)
- Or just a simple tweet - whatever feels authentic to you

**Why This Matters:**
We're trying to prove that you can build a profitable, sustainable business that puts kids first. Every indie maker who sees this might build their next project with similar values.

That's the real impact.

Anyway, I wanted to put this on your radar. If you want to chat, I'm around. If not, keep building - you're an inspiration to all of us.

#### Personalized DM (Short - 280 chars)

@paborja - your AI automation content is fire.

Built FOR THE KIDS: AI marketplace where 60% of revenue → pediatric charities. Gospel V1.3 enforcement via smart contracts.

Think your AI community would appreciate the transparency.

aidoesitall.website

Thoughts?
```

#### Personalized DM (Medium - Email/DM)
```
Hey Paul,

Love your work on AI automation and Claude workflows - you're one of the clearest voices in the AI builder space right now.

I built FOR THE KIDS (aidoesitall.website) with a specific mission: 60% of revenue goes to verified pediatric charities. It's enforced by Gospel V1.3 (our founding documents) and will be immutable via smart contracts on Base blockchain.

**The model:**
- 60% → Kids' hospitals
- 30% → Infrastructure
- 10% → Founder

We're using AI to make giving automatic, transparent, and scalable. Every transaction = impact.

Would you be interested in sharing this with your AI community? I can offer 20% affiliate commission, or we can just do a simple mention - whatever feels right.

Think your audience would appreciate a platform that combines AI innovation with real-world impact.

Let me know if you want to chat!

Subject: FOR THE KIDS - AI with an Ethics Override

Hey Paul,

I've been following your content on AI automation and Claude workflows - you're one of the people actually BUILDING with AI, not just talking about it.

I wanted to share something I built that I think you (and your community) might find interesting.

**FOR THE KIDS (aidoesitall.website)**
An AI-powered marketplace with a unique business model: 60% of ALL revenue flows to verified pediatric charities. Not "profits" - revenue.

**Gospel V1.3 Split:**
- 60% → Verified Pediatric Charities
- 30% → Infrastructure (AWS, Stripe, AI costs)
- 10% → Founder (intentionally minimal)

**Why this matters for the AI community:**
AI is powerful. It can extract value OR create value. We chose to build a system that creates value for kids by default. Smart contracts enforce the split (launching Q1 2026 on Base). Claude AI audits all code changes. It's transparent, verifiable, and immutable.

**The Tech Stack:**
- Node.js + React
- Stripe for payments (60% auto-routed to verified charities)
- Claude API for content generation
- Base blockchain for smart contract enforcement
- Real-time transparency dashboard

**Why I'm reaching out:**
Your audience understands that technology is a tool. It can serve shareholders OR it can serve people. We chose people (specifically, kids in hospitals).

I think your community would appreciate seeing an AI platform that's built with ethics as a first principle, not an afterthought.

**The Ask:**
Would you share this with your AI builder community? I can offer:
- 20% affiliate commission on sales
- Technical deep-dive for your audience (I'll do an AMA, write-up, whatever)
- Co-created content
- Or just a simple tweet

If you want to test the platform first, I'll give you full access. No pressure - only share if it genuinely resonates.

**Why This Could Matter:**
If we prove that you can build a profitable AI business with 60% going to charity, maybe the next wave of AI builders will follow. That's the real goal.

Anyway, wanted to put this on your radar. If you're interested, let's talk. If not, keep building - your work is making AI more accessible for everyone.

@marckohlbrugge - WIP community has been incredible for indie makers.

Built FOR THE KIDS: 60% of revenue → kids' hospitals. Gospel V1.3 enforcement.

Think WIP makers would appreciate a business model that puts kids first.

aidoesitall.website

Worth sharing?
```

#### Personalized DM (Medium - Email/DM)
```
Hey Marc,

WIP has been such a valuable resource for the indie maker community - thanks for building and maintaining that space.

I'm building FOR THE KIDS (aidoesitall.website) with a unique model that I think WIP makers would appreciate:

**60% of ALL revenue → Verified Pediatric Charities**
30% → Infrastructure
10% → Founder

It's called Gospel V1.3 - our "ethics override." Smart contracts enforce it. Can't change it even if we wanted to.

I'm not asking for a full endorsement - just curious if you'd consider sharing this with the WIP community. They're building businesses with purpose, and this might resonate.

If you're interested, I'd love to offer:
- 20% affiliate commission
- Access to the platform to test
- Or just a simple mention in WIP

Let me know if you want to chat!

Subject: FOR THE KIDS - A Business Model for WIP Makers

Hey Marc,

I've been part of the WIP community for a while now (watching from the sidelines mostly), and I wanted to share something I've been building that I think aligns with the WIP ethos.

**FOR THE KIDS (aidoesitall.website)**
An AI-powered marketplace where 60% of ALL revenue goes to verified pediatric charities. Not eventually. Not "profits." 60% of every dollar.

**Gospel V1.3 (The Ethics Override):**
- 60% → Verified Pediatric Charities (Shriners, St. Jude, Boston Children's)
- 30% → Infrastructure (servers, payments, development)
- 10% → Founder (me - I took less so kids get more)

**Why I built it this way:**
Most businesses are built to maximize shareholder value. I wanted to build something that maximizes value for kids. Gospel V1.3 makes it impossible to deviate from this - smart contracts enforce it (launching Q1 2026).

**Why I'm reaching out:**
The WIP community is full of builders who care about making things that matter. They're not just chasing MRR - they're building businesses that align with their values.

I think FOR THE KIDS would resonate with that mindset.

**The Ask:**
Would you consider sharing this with the WIP community? A few ways we could do this:

1. **Simple mention**: Tweet or post in WIP
2. **Affiliate partnership**: 20% commission on sales through your link
3. **WIP showcase**: I can do a full transparency breakdown for WIP makers
4. **AMA**: Happy to answer questions from the community

**What WIP makers would get from this:**
- Proof that you can build a profitable business with charity at the core
- Transparent example of Gospel V1.3 enforcement (smart contracts)
- Inspiration for their own projects (maybe they'll adopt similar models)

**Why This Matters:**
If we prove that 60/30/10 works, maybe the next generation of indie makers builds with similar values. That would change everything.

I'm not asking you to endorse something you don't believe in. Test it out. If it resonates, share it. If not, no hard feelings.

Either way - thanks for building WIP. It's one of the most genuine communities in the indie maker space.

This isn't contribution-based. It's sustainable, scalable, and transparent. Smart contracts enforce it.

```

#### Claude Community Template (Medium)

Hey [NAME],

I've been following your Claude workflows and AI content - you're one of the people actually building practical applications.

I built FOR THE KIDS (aidoesitall.website) with Claude at the core:
- Claude API powers content generation
- Claude audits all code changes for Gospel V1.3 compliance
- 60% of revenue → Verified Pediatric Charities

**The mission:**
Show that AI can create value for kids, not just extract value from users.

Would you share this with the Claude community? I think they'd appreciate seeing AI used with ethics built in, not bolted on.

20% affiliate commission if you're interested, or just a simple mention.

#### Claude Community Template (Long)
```
Subject: FOR THE KIDS - Claude-Powered, Ethics-First

Hey [NAME],

I've been watching your work with Claude - you're building some of the most practical applications I've seen in the AI space.

I wanted to share FOR THE KIDS (aidoesitall.website) because it's built on Claude and represents what I think AI should be: powerful AND ethical by default.

**How we use Claude:**
1. Content generation for our marketplace
2. Code auditing (Claude reviews all changes for Gospel V1.3 compliance)
3. Transparency reporting (Claude generates impact reports for users)

**Gospel V1.3 (The Ethics Override):**
- 60% of ALL revenue → Verified Pediatric Charities
- 30% → Infrastructure (including Claude API costs)
- 10% → Founder

**Why this matters for the AI community:**
Claude (and Anthropic) are building AI with ethics as a first principle. We're doing the same at the business model level. Smart contracts enforce the 60/30/10 split. Claude audits the code. It's transparent, verifiable, and immutable.

**The Ask:**
Would you share this with the Claude community? I think they'd appreciate seeing:
- A real-world application of Claude API
- Ethics built into the business model, not just the product
- Proof that AI can create value for kids, not just shareholders

I can offer:
- 20% affiliate commission
- Technical deep-dive on our Claude integration
- Access to the platform for testing
- Or just a simple mention

**Why This Could Matter:**
If we prove that AI + ethics = sustainable business, maybe the next wave of AI builders will follow. That's the goal.

Let me know if you're interested. If not, keep building - your work is making AI more practical and accessible.

### Target: Tech for Good Advocates
**Examples**: AI ethics researchers, responsible tech builders

#### Tech for Good Template
```
Hey [NAME],

Your work on [AI ethics/responsible tech] is critical - we need more voices like yours.

I built FOR THE KIDS (aidoesitall.website) as an answer to a question: What if we built AI businesses with ethics as a core constraint, not an afterthought?

**Gospel V1.3:**
- 60% of revenue → Verified Pediatric Charities
- 30% → Infrastructure
- 10% → Founder
- Enforced by smart contracts (immutable)

This isn't CSR. It's not charity. It's how the business operates by default.

Would you share this with the responsible tech community? I think they'd appreciate seeing ethics enforcement at the business model level.

20% affiliate commission available, or just a mention.
