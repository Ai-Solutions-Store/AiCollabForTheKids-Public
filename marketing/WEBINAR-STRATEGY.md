### LIVE Q&A MODERATION TIPS

**Before the Webinar:**
1. Assign one person to monitor chat (not the speaker)
2. Have "top 10" pre-screened questions ready (warmup)
3. Brief speaker: "If you don't know, say so—we'll follow up"
4. Set time limit per question (2-3 min answers)
5. Create FAQ slide to reference repeated questions

**During Q&A:**
1. Start with warmup question (easy answer, builds confidence)
2. Mix question types (educator, parent, investor, etc.)
3. Alternate between pre-screened and live chat
4. Watch for popular questions (many upvotes in chat)
5. If something's unclear, reword and ask again
6. Thank questioner by name
7. Use speaker's answer to pivot to next topic (smooth transitions)
8. Save hardest questions for near the end (time pressure = shorter answers)

**If Things Go Wrong:**
- Q: "That's a great question, but outside our scope today. Let's follow up 1-on-1."
- Q: "I don't know the answer. We'll research and get back to you within 48 hours."
- Q: "Can you rephrase that? I want to make sure we address what you're asking."
- Silence: "Great question. [Speaker], thoughts?"

**Closing Q&A:**
```
"We got 47 questions, and we answered [X] live.
For the rest, we're sending answers via email tomorrow.

Thank you for the engagement. This is what makes webinars great."

### Email 4: OBJECTION HANDLING (Triggered by action/inaction)

**If They Downloaded Slides But Didn't Sign Up:**

**Subject:** "The #1 Reason People Don't Start (And Why It Doesn't Matter)"

**Body:**
```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I noticed you downloaded the webinar slides but haven't tried the platform yet.

Common reason? Analysis paralysis.

"I want to make sure it's right for my situation."
"I need to talk to my [spouse/boss/team]."
"I want to compare it to other options."

All valid. And also—here's the thing:

YOU DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE ANYTHING.

The 30-day free trial is exactly for this. You get:
- Full access to the platform
- Real data on how it works for your kid/school
- Live support to answer your specific questions
- Zero risk (full refund if not happy)
- Zero commitment (no contract required)

So the question isn't "Is this right for me?"
The question is "Can I afford NOT to try it?"

THE REAL COST OF WAITING:

Every week of delay = another week your kid isn't getting personalized support.

For struggling students, that compounds.

One month delay = 4 weeks of catching up you have to do later.

THE BARRIER ISN'T REAL:

"What if it's hard to set up?"
? 5-minute setup. Support team helps.

"What if my kid doesn't like it?"
? 92% engagement rate. Plus: refund if not.

"What if I don't understand the tech?"
? You don't need to. Your kid will intuitively use it.

"What if it costs too much?"
? $[X]/month is less than one pizza night. Is your kid's education worth a pizza?

ONE THING:

Just try it. Seriously.

[START_FREE_TRIAL]

If after 7 days you're not impressed, stop. No questions asked.

But I bet you will be.

### SPECIFIC REPURPOSING GUIDE

#### TIKTOK/REELS CLIPS (10 clips per webinar)

**Clip 1: The Hook**
```
LENGTH: 15 seconds
CONTENT: Extract the most surprising statistic

EXAMPLE:
"I was shocked when [EXPERT] revealed that 34% of students
improve learning outcomes in just ONE semester using AI tutoring.

That's not luck. That's science."

CAPTION: "#EdTech #AI #Learning #FTTK"
HASHTAGS: #ForTheKids #Education #Innovation
```

**Clip 2: The Problem**
```
LENGTH: 30 seconds
CONTENT: What problem does this solve?

EXAMPLE:
"Here's the problem with traditional tutoring:
- Cost: $50-100/hour
- Time: Limited availability
- Personalization: One-size-fits-all

What if tutoring was personalized, affordable, AND effective?

That's what AI tutoring does."

CTA: "Swipe up to learn more" or "Link in bio"
```

**Clip 3: The Demo**
```
LENGTH: 45 seconds
CONTENT: Show product in action

EXAMPLE:
[Show student using platform]
"Here's what AI tutoring looks like in real-time.

This student is struggling with algebra.
The AI detects that and adjusts difficulty DOWN.

Student gets a win.
Confidence builds.
Learning accelerates.

That's personalization at scale."
```

**Clip 4: The Question**
```
LENGTH: 15 seconds
CONTENT: Ask question to drive engagement

EXAMPLE:
"Question: If you could give your kid personalized tutoring
without the $100/hour cost, would you?

60% of the revenue goes to pediatric charities.
So your kid learns AND helps other kids.

Reply: YES or NO"

PURPOSE: Drive engagement (likes, comments, shares)
```

**Clip 5: The Expert Quote**
```
LENGTH: 30 seconds
CONTENT: Pull best quote from expert

EXAMPLE:
"[EXPERT] said this and it stopped me:

'AI doesn't replace teachers.
It gives them BACK the thing that matters most: TIME.'

And that time goes to connection, mentoring, and real growth.

That's the future of education."
```

**Clip 6: The Case Study**
```
LENGTH: 60 seconds
CONTENT: Real outcome story

EXAMPLE:
"Meet Sarah. She was struggling in math.

Her school implemented AI tutoring.

After 8 weeks:
- Math scores up 34%
- Confidence back
- Asking for help instead of hiding
- She's actually EXCITED about learning

That's what we're after.

[FTTK Logo]"
```

**Clip 7: The Myth Buster**
```
LENGTH: 30 seconds
CONTENT: Common misconception + truth

EXAMPLE:
"MYTH: 'AI tutoring is just screen time'

TRUTH: AI tutoring is personalized learning that adjusts to your kid
in real-time. It's the opposite of passive.

Students are making decisions, struggling, problem-solving.

That's learning."
```

**Clip 8: The Transparency Moment**
```
LENGTH: 45 seconds
CONTENT: Gospel V1.3 in action

EXAMPLE:
"Most companies: 50/50 split (company vs. charity)
Us: 60/30/10 split

That means:
- 60% goes to verified pediatric charities
