## 3. Smart Contract Transparency Explainer

Smart contract routing is a way to ensure that funds are transferred securely and transparently from one wallet to another. Here's a simplified explanation:

**The Players:**

1. **Donors**: The people who want to contribute money to the kids.
2. **Organizers**: The ones who manage the fund-raising process and make sure everything runs smoothly.
3. **Recipients**: The children or families who receive the funds.

**How it Works:**

1. **Creating a Smart Contract**: A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement written directly into code. This contract outlines how the funds will be transferred, when, and to whom.
2. **Adding Conditions**: The smart contract is programmed with conditions that must be met before the funds can be released. For example, "Only when the kids receive their medical treatment" or "Only when the school pays for the new equipment".
3. **Blockchain Network**: The smart contract is deployed on a blockchain network like Ethereum. This decentralized system ensures transparency and security.
4. **Funding Process**: Donors send funds to the organizers' wallet, who then trigger the smart contract.
5. **Verification**: Smart contract rules are checked by the blockchain network. If all conditions are met, the funds are released.

**Security and Transparency:**

1. **Immutable Ledger**: The blockchain's decentralized ledger ensures that once a transaction is recorded, it can't be altered or deleted.
2. **Publicly Visible**: Smart contracts
