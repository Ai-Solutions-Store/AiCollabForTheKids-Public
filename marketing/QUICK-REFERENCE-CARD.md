## GOSPEL COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

### ALWAYS SAY:
? **60% to Verified Pediatric Charities** (NOT 60%)
? **30% to Infrastructure** (NOT operations)
? **10% to Founder** (NOT 20%)
? **Profit Allocation** (NOT contribution, NOT treasury)
? **DAO Treasury** (NOT DAO treasury)
? **Purchase/Subscribe** (NOT contribute)
? **Customer/User** (NOT supporter)
? **Beneficiary Allocation** (NOT beneficiary allocation)
? **Revenue Split** (acceptable term)
? **Gospel V1.3** (NOT V1.2)

### NEVER SAY:
? 60% to charity (OUTDATED - Ethics Override V1.3 changed this)
? 20% to founder (WRONG - Founder took pay cut to 10%)
? "contribute" / "contribution" (Forbidden language - we're profit allocators)
? "treasury" / "DAO treasury" (Forbidden - we're DAO sovereign)
? "" (We're NOT a charity - customers buy products)
? Gospel V1.3 (OUTDATED - current version is V1.3)

### IF YOU MESS UP:
**Immediately correct with:** "Correction: [Correct Gospel V1.3 language]. Apologies for the error. FOR THE KIDS operates under Gospel V1.3: 60/30/10 split, immutable."

## ONE-PAGE MISSION REMINDER

**WHY WE'RE HERE:**
To prove that companies can hardcode generosity into their DNA. That profit and charity aren't enemies. That transparency isn't marketing�it's math.

**WHAT WE'RE BUILDING:**
An AI platform where 60% of all revenue automatically flows to verified pediatric charities via smart contracts. Not promises. Code.

**HOW WE WIN:**
Every backer, every share, every upvote = more people learning that business can be built differently. If we hit our funding goal, incredible. If we don't, we still proved the model works.

**THE MISSION IS ETERNAL:**
The smart contract runs forever. Long after this campaign ends, long after we're gone, the 60% allocation continues. That's the power of code over promises.
