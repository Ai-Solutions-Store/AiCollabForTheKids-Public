Hi [Organization Leader Name],

We're reaching out because your organization's mission aligns perfectly with
what we're building at FOR THE KIDS.

ABOUT FOR THE KIDS:
FOR THE KIDS is an AI-powered platform where every purchase directly funds
verified pediatric charities. Unlike contribution-based nonprofits, we're a
for-profit company with a structural commitment: 60% of all revenue ? pediatric
charities (Gospel V1.3 compliance).

Why your org should care:
1. AUTHENTIC STUDENT ENGAGEMENT
   Students often say they want to "help" but lack clear pathways. FOR THE KIDS
   makes it tangible: use this platform = help real children.

2. PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES

   - Co-host impact talks on campus
   - Run co-branded awareness campaigns
   - Participate in quarterly impact transparency events
   - Potentially earn commissions (5% referral program)

3. ALIGNED VALUES
   You care about outcomes, not promises. We publish quarterly financial
   audits showing:
   - Exact $ amounts to charities
   - Verified charity recipients
   - Impact metrics (children helped)
   - Smart contract proof on blockchain

TANGIBLE BENEFITS FOR YOUR ORG:
- Recurring supporter base (students who use FOR THE KIDS)
- Co-branded marketing amplification
- Speaking platform for your leaders
- Potential grant opportunities tied to partnership

WHAT WE'RE ASKING:
Just 1 hour/month of leadership time to:
- Co-host 1 quarterly impact talk (live or recorded)
- Cross-promote via your channels
- Help us refine messaging with student feedback

This is a real partnership, not just a sponsorship.

Want to explore? Let's grab 20 minutes on [3 dates/times].

### TEMPLATE 4: Student Government Leader
**Subject:** Campus Initiative: Fund Charities While Studying - FOR THE KIDS

---

```
Hi [Student Government President/Leadership Council],

I'm reaching out about an exciting opportunity to bring FOR THE KIDS to
[University Name].

THE PITCH:
What if students could fund pediatric charities just by using the tools
they already use for learning? That's FOR THE KIDS.

THE STUDENT GOVERNMENT ANGLE:
1. Brand new revenue stream for campus projects
   - Partner with FOR THE KIDS
   - Earn 5% commission on student referrals
   - Fund your initiatives (retreat, events, etc.)

2. Campus engagement opportunity
   - Table at student fair
   - Announce program at SG meetings
   - Get recognition as champions of student philanthropy

3. Individual student benefit
   - Campus ambassadors earn recognition + micro-stipends
   - Students can see their personal impact on our dashboard
   - Resume credibility: "Helped raise $X for pediatric charities"

THE STATS:
- 60% of platform revenue ? verified pediatric charities
- 30% ? infrastructure and scaling
- 10% ? sustainable founder income

So if 500 students use FOR THE KIDS for [typical activity], and we generate
$5,000 in revenue that quarter, $3,000 goes directly to children's charities.

WHAT WE NEED FROM SG:
- 1 announcements cycle across campus channels
- Optional: 1 tabling event at student fair
- Optional: feature in SG newsletter + social

That's it. Super low lift, massive social good impact.

Can we set up 15 mins to talk strategy? [3 dates/times]

Thanks,
[Your Name]

## FINAL NOTES

**Remember:**
This is not a transaction. This is a movement.

Every email you send, every ambassador you recruit, every hackathon you sponsor�that's a moment to change how the next generation thinks about technology and social responsibility.

Students are hungry for this. They WANT to build things that matter. They just need a clear path + transparent impact.

FOR THE KIDS gives them that path. Our job is to show them the door.
