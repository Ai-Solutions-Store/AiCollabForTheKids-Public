### ABOUT SECTION (Full - 2,000 character limit)

**VERSION 1: Professional/Corporate**
```
FOR THE KIDS is a pioneering AI collaboration platform that fundamentally reimagines how technology companies can drive social impact. We've embedded charitable giving into our corporate structure through an planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing) that automatically allocates 60% of all revenue to verified pediatric charities.

OUR MISSION
To democratize access to advanced AI tools while creating sustainable funding for children's healthcare, education, and welfare programs worldwide.

THE GOSPEL V1.3 MODEL (60/30/10 Split)
� 60% ? Verified Pediatric Charities (transparent, on-chain)
� 30% ? Infrastructure & Growth
� 10% ? Founder & Team

This isn't marketing. It's our legal and technical architecture. The split is enforced by Ethereum smart contracts and governed by our community DAO.

WHAT WE OFFER
? AI-powered collaboration tools for education and enterprise
? Transparent impact tracking on public blockchain
? Community governance through DAO participation
? Educational resources for next-generation AI literacy

WHO WE SERVE
� Schools and universities integrating AI into curriculum
� Non-profits seeking scalable technology solutions
� Enterprises committed to ESG and social responsibility
� Parents and educators preparing kids for an AI-driven world
� Anyone who believes technology should serve humanity

VERIFIED IMPACT
Every transaction is recorded on Ethereum. Every dollar is traceable. Every impact metric is public. We're not just talking about transparency�we're building it into our code.

JOIN US
Whether you're an educator, developer, investor, or simply someone who believes in building technology that gives back�there's a place for you here.

INCORPORATED: Delaware C-Corp | GOVERNANCE: DAO | BLOCKCHAIN: Ethereum
```

**VERSION 2: Founder Story/Authentic**
```
FOR THE KIDS started with a simple question: What if a technology company was legally required to give most of its money away?

THE ORIGIN
Founder Joshua Coleman, a systems engineer and father, spent years watching AI companies talk about "doing good" while optimizing for extraction. He built something different: a platform where charity isn't a side project�it's the core business model.

THE MECHANISM
Through Ethereum smart contracts (immutable code), 60% of every dollar flows automatically to verified pediatric charities. Not "eventually." Not "after we exit." NOW. Every transaction. Every time.

WHY IT MATTERS
� $8.3M+ committed to pediatric causes (projected first year)
� 100% transparency via public blockchain
� Community governance through DAO
� No board can override the 60% allocation
� No acquisition can change the mission

WHAT WE'VE BUILT
An AI collaboration platform designed for:
- Educational institutions training the next generation
- Healthcare organizations expanding access to AI tools
- Enterprises integrating ethical AI into operations
- Families teaching kids to use AI responsibly

THE GOSPEL V1.3 PROMISE
60% Charities | 30% Infrastructure | 10% Team
This split is hardcoded. Immutable. Enforced by mathematics, not goodwill.

OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
While others optimize for valuation, we optimize for impact. This creates:
? Authentic community loyalty
? Mission-driven talent attraction
? Partnership opportunities with purpose-aligned orgs
? Customer acquisition through shared values

THE INVITATION
If you're tired of tech companies that talk about impact but optimize for exits...
If you believe the next generation deserves better from their technology...
If you want to build something that matters...

Join us. Invest. Partner. Spread the word.

FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS.

**RECOMMENDED:** Use Version 1 initially (professional), switch to Version 2 once Series A discussions begin (shows founder conviction).

### STORY SECTION (Unlimited)

**FULL STORY VERSION:**
```
THE BEGINNING

FOR THE KIDS was born from a father's frustration with the tech industry. Joshua Coleman, a systems engineer, watched companies pay lip service to "social good" while optimizing every decision for shareholder returns. He asked a dangerous question:

"What if we built it backwards?"

THE BREAKTHROUGH

Instead of contributing profits after everyone gets paid, what if charity came FIRST? What if it was mathematically impossible to prioritize profits over impact?

Enter blockchain.

By encoding the 60/30/10 split into Ethereum smart contracts, Joshua created something unprecedented: a company that CANNOT legally reduce charitable giving. The code won't allow it. The DAO can't override it. Even an acquisition can't change it.

60% to pediatric charities. Forever. No matter what.

THE MISSION

Every subscription unlocks AI tools for learning, creating, and building�while simultaneously funding:
� Hospital beds in pediatric wards
� Therapy sessions for children in need
� Educational resources for underserved schools
� Medical research for childhood diseases
� Food security programs for vulnerable families

THE GOSPEL V1.3 MODEL

60% ? Verified Pediatric Charities (transparent, tracked on blockchain)
30% ? Infrastructure & Platform Growth
10% ? Founder & Team Sustainability

This isn't a marketing promise. It's our legal architecture.

WHY IT WORKS

Traditional charities rely on contributions that dry up during downturns. We've created a BUSINESS MODEL where social impact scales with commercial success. The more we grow, the more kids we help. Permanently.

THE COMMUNITY

We're governed by a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) where:
- Token holders vote on charity selection
- Impact metrics are publicly verifiable
- All transactions are recorded on-chain
- No single entity controls the mission

THE INVITATION

Whether you're a parent, educator, entrepreneur, or simply someone who believes technology should serve humanity�there's a place for you here.

Subscribe to our platform ? Access AI tools + Fund pediatric care
Join our DAO ? Help select charities and guide our mission
Spread the word ? Every share helps us reach more people
Partner with us ? Let's build impact together

THE PROMISE

For every child learning to use AI on our platform...
For every hospital bed funded by our smart contracts...
For every family that receives support through our charitable partners...

We're proving that capitalism and compassion aren't opposites.

FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS.
