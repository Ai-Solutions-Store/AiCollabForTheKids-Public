### Threads Post 2: The Math (Visual Appeal)
Let's do the math:

?? 60% ? Sick kids (always)
?? 30% ? Infrastructure
?? 10% ? Founder

The founder TOOK LESS so kids GET MORE.

That's Gospel V1.3. Immutable. Blockchain-verified.

### Threads Post 3: The Urgency
? 18 DAYS LEFT ?

Every hour that passes is an hour closer to missing our goal.

### Threads Post 4: The Founder Story
I reduced my share from 20% to 10%.

Most founders fight for MORE equity.
I fought for less.

Why? Because when I look at my kids, I see every kid.

60% to pediatric charities isn't charity - it's justice.

### Threads Post 6: The Problem
Traditional charities lose 20-40% to overhead.

CEOs make $500K while families go bankrupt from hospital bills.

You've been burned. You've lost trust.

We built FOR THE KIDS to fix that:
- Blockchain-verified
- 60% of REVENUE (not profit)
- Hardcoded into the platform

Trust, restored.

### Threads Post 7: The Technology
This isn't a nonprofit.
This isn't a charity.
This is a REVENUE-GENERATING PLATFORM with an ethical core.

60% of revenue ? Automatic contributions
Smart contracts ? Immutable rules
Blockchain ? Total transparency

Technology serving humanity.

Fund it: aidoesitall.website

### Threads Post 8: The Compound Effect
Your $25 today doesn't just help once.

It funds a platform that generates revenue.
That revenue triggers contributions.
Those contributions compound FOREVER.

$25 ? $250 ? $2,500 ? $25,000 in charitable impact over time.

That's leverage. That's FOR THE KIDS.

60% means 60%.

## BLUESKY POSTS (15 Posts)
### Platform-native, decentralized community-focused

### Bluesky Post 1: The Introduction
Just launched our Kickstarter for FOR THE KIDS - a platform with 60% revenue hardcoded to pediatric charities.

Not a nonprofit. Not charity theater. A revenue-generating business with an immutable ethical core.

18 days | $100K goal

aidoesitall.website

What if profit could ALWAYS serve purpose?

---

### Bluesky Post 2: The Decentralized Ethos
Building on Bluesky because we believe in decentralization.

Building FOR THE KIDS because we believe in automation.

60% revenue to charities isn't a promise - it's smart contract law. Immutable. Transparent. Transparent.

That's the future of ethical business.

Back us: aidoesitall.website

---

### Bluesky Post 3: The Math
The split:
60% ? Verified pediatric charities
30% ? Infrastructure
10% ? Founder (took LESS so kids get MORE)

This is Gospel V1.3. Hardcoded. Blockchain-verified.

Can YOUR business say the same?

Fund the future: aidoesitall.website

---

### Bluesky Post 4: The Technology Stack
Built with:
- Smart contracts (immutable 60% allocation)
- Blockchain verification (Base network)
- DAO governance (transparent treasury)
- Automated contributions (no human intervention)

This isn't charity - it's ARCHITECTURE.

18 days to fund it: aidoesitall.website

---

### Bluesky Post 5: The Transparency Challenge
Challenge to every business on Bluesky:

Could you open-source your revenue split?
Could you blockchain-verify your contributions?
Could you make your ethics IMMUTABLE?

We did. Gospel V1.3 = 60/30/10.

Join the transparency revolution: aidoesitall.website

---

### Bluesky Post 6: The Problem Statement
Charities have a trust problem:
- 20-40% lost to overhead
- Opaque accounting
- Executive salaries > impact
- No verification mechanism

FOR THE KIDS solves this with code:
- 60% off revenue (not profit)
- Blockchain-verified
- Smart contract enforcement

Back us: aidoesitall.website

---

### Bluesky Post 7: The Compound Thesis
Your backing compounds.

$25 today funds development
? Platform launches
? Generates revenue
? 60% flows to charities (automatically)
? Forever

That $25 becomes $2,500 in impact over time.

THAT'S leverage.

aidoesitall.website

---

### Bluesky Post 8: The Founder Philosophy
Why did I reduce my share from 20% to 10%?

Because maximizing founder equity is 20th-century thinking.

21st-century founders optimize for IMPACT.

60% to kids > 10% more for me.

That's Gospel V1.3.

Join the movement: aidoesitall.website

---

### Bluesky Post 9: The Community Call
We're building in public on Bluesky because this community understands:
- Decentralization > centralization
- Transparency > opacity
- Code > promises
- Impact > vanity metrics

18 days to $100K.

Are you in?

### Bluesky Post 10: The Technical Deep Dive
Smart contract: Planned (Q1 2026)
Network: Base Mainnet
Function: Immutable 60/30/10 split
Verification: BaseScan (public ledger)

This isn't marketing. This is ARCHITECTURE.

Verify yourself: aidoesitall.website

### Bluesky Post 11: The Ethics Override
"Gospel V1.3 - Ethics Override"

We UPGRADED our ethics:
Previous industry standard: ~50% to charities
V1.3: 60% to charities

Founder took 10% LESS (moved from his share to kids).

When was the last time a CEO reduced their own comp to help people?

That's the culture: aidoesitall.website

---

### Bluesky Post 12: The Open Source Commitment
Our roadmap:
? Smart contracts (verified on BaseScan)
? Revenue allocation (transparent)
?? Coming: Full codebase open-source
?? Coming: DAO governance token
?? Coming: Public audit dashboard

Radical transparency. Always.

Fund it: aidoesitall.website

This isn't just a platform.

It's proof-of-concept that:

We're building the template.

No middlemen. No trust required. Just code.

### Mastodon Post 5: The Anti-Surveillance Capitalism (500 chars)
Surveillance capitalism: Extract data, sell attention.

FOR THE KIDS: Extract revenue, give to kids.

We don't:
? Track you
? Sell your data
? Exploit attention

We do:
? Generate ethical revenue
? Auto-contribute 60%
? Respect privacy

Different model. Better world.

### Mastodon Post 6: The Federation Model (500 chars)
Just like Mastodon federates servers, FOR THE KIDS federates IMPACT.

Every instance = Every business
Every admin = Every founder
Every user = Every customer

Imagine if 60% revenue-sharing was the PROTOCOL, not the exception.

We're building the reference implementation.

### Mastodon Post 7: The Community Over Profit (500 chars)
Mastodon chose community over profit.
We chose kids over profit.

Same ethos. Different execution.

You host servers with contributions.
We fund charities with revenue.

Both reject surveillance capitalism.
Both prioritize people over shareholders.
