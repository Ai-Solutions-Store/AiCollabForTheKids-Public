We think your readers would love the technical story of how blockchain solves the

## SECTION 9: CRYPTO PODCAST PITCH TEMPLATES

### Template 1: Technical Deep-Dive

**Podcast Type:** Developer-focused (e.g., Bankless, Unchained, Epicenter)

**Pitch Subject:** "Building a DAO for Pediatric Charity - Technical Innovation"

**Pitch Email:**

```
Subject: Guest Appearance: Smart Contracts for Transparent Charity Allocation

Hi [Host Name],

We're building a web3 platform where backend systems enforce a 60/30/10 profit
allocation to pediatric charities - no trust required, all verifiable on Base
Mainnet via planned smart contract (backend enforcement active).

We think your audience (technical builders) would find the smart contract
architecture + DAO governance angle compelling.

Topics we could cover:
- Architecture of immutable charitable allocation
- Why Base chain is ideal for social impact
- Security considerations for charity contracts
- Integration with DeFi protocols (Aave, Yearn, etc.)
- Live demo of BaseScan verification

We're also open to discussing broader theme: "Can smart contracts solve
problems traditional nonprofits can't?"

Availability: [Your availability]

Best,
Joshua Coleman
Founder, FOR THE KIDS

**Targets:**
- Bankless Podcast
- Unchained (Laura Shin)
- Epicenter
- The Defiant Podcast
- Web3 Builders

### Template 2: Impact & Philosophy

**Podcast Type:** Mainstream crypto (e.g., Pomp, Lex Fridman)

**Pitch Subject:** "Why Crypto Enables Better Charity - Philosophy + Proof"

**Pitch Email:**

```
Subject: Guest Appearance: Crypto's Real-World Impact on Pediatric Charities

Hi [Host Name],

While crypto gets criticized as "only for rich people," we built a platform
proving that blockchain creates MORE transparent, MORE accountable charitable
giving than traditional nonprofits.

Unlike traditional charities (where 20-30% goes to overhead), our smart contract
ensures 60% reaches pediatric charities - verified on-chain, no exceptions.

Topics we could explore:
- Misconceptions about crypto's social impact
- How smart contracts create accountability
- Why the best charities will be built on blockchain
- The philosophy of "code is law" for good
- Real impact metrics (X children helped, Y dollars allocated)

Why now: Crypto community is ready to prove "we're not just about making money" -
and pediatric charities are the perfect mission.

Best,
Joshua Coleman
```

**Targets:**
- Pomp Podcast (Anthony Pompliano)
- Lex Fridman (AI + crypto focus)
- Tales from the Crypt
- What Bitcoin Did
- Bankless Podcast

### Template 3: DeFi Innovation

**Podcast Type:** DeFi-focused (e.g., DeFi Download, Lido)

**Pitch Subject:** "DeFi for Good - New Revenue Models for Social Impact"

**Pitch Email:**

```
Subject: DeFi Podcast: How Smart Contracts Enable Sustainable Charity Funding

Hi [Host Name],

We built a DeFi model where users deposit crypto, earn yield (8-12% APY),
and 60% of that yield goes directly to verified pediatric charities.

This solves a real DeFi problem: "How do we create sustainable, transparent
funding for public goods?"

Our answer: Smart contracts + yield farming + automated allocation.

Podcast discussion topics:
- DeFi yields for social impact (compared to traditional giving)
- Smart contract economics of charitable allocation
- Scaling pediatric charities through DeFi
- Integration opportunities with major protocols (Aave, Yearn, Curve)
- "Why DeFi is better for charity than traditional finance"

Best,
Joshua Coleman
```

**Targets:**
- DeFi Download
- Lido Podcast
- The Block Podcast
- Token Gating Podcast
- DeFi Governance Podcast

### Template 4: Founder Story

**Podcast Type:** Entrepreneurship-focused

**Pitch Subject:** "Building a Crypto Startup That's Actually For Good"

**Pitch Email:**

```
Subject: Founder Interview: Building Crypto for Impact vs. Profit

Hi [Host Name],

Most crypto startups chase valuations. We chose a different path:
60% of all revenue goes to pediatric charities - hardcoded in smart
contracts, unchangeable.

As a founder, this meant taking 10% instead of the standard 50-70%.

Why? Because blockchain lets us build something better than traditional
nonprofits - transparent, scalable, incentive-aligned.

Podcast topics:
- The founder's journey to charity-first business model
- Economics of taking 10% instead of standard founder salary
- How backend systems enforce mission-aligned incentives
- Building on Base chain for efficiency
- Scaling impact vs. scaling profits
- Philosophy: "What if crypto's killer app was actually helping kids?"

Best,
Joshua Coleman
Founder, FOR THE KIDS

### Template 5: AI + Web3 Convergence

**Podcast Type:** AI + Crypto blend

**Pitch Subject:** "AI + Crypto + Charity = The Future"

**Pitch Email:**

```
Subject: AI-Powered Platform Using Web3 for Pediatric Charity Impact

Hi [Host Name],

We built an AI platform (think ChatGPT for kids' education + skill-building)
that generates revenue, with 60% flowing directly to pediatric charities via
smart contracts on Base.

This is interesting because it combines three trends:
1. AI productivity tools generating real revenue
2. Web3 enabling transparent allocation of that revenue
3. Mission-driven business model from day one

Podcast topics:
- Using AI to fund pediatric charities (vs. AI wasteful electricity)
- Web3 solves AI safety + accountability problems
- backend systems enforce charitable mission better than corporate ESG
- How this AI+Web3 combo could revolutionize nonprofit funding
- Technical deep-dive on smart contract architecture

Best,
Joshua Coleman
```

- The Defiant AI segment
- a16z Podcast (Crypto episode)
- LessWrong (AI safety angle)

**Podcast Type:** Base ecosystem + Coinbase partners

**Pitch Subject:** "Base Case Study: From Smart Contract to Real-World Impact"

Hi [Host Name],

We chose Base (Coinbase's L2) specifically because:
1. Sub-cent transaction costs (maximizes charity allocation)
2. Seamless Coinbase integration for contributions
3. Ecosystem support for public goods

This is a success story worth sharing: One platform, Base chain,
60K+ potential supporters, $millions to pediatric charities.

Podcast discussion:
- Why we chose Base over Ethereum/Solana/other chains
- Technical advantages of Base for charitable allocation
- Base ecosystem support + resources
- ROI: How Base L2 efficiency multiplies impact

Subject: Collaboration Idea: "How Blockchain Creates Better Charity" (15 min video)

Hi [Name],

I've been watching your videos on [DeFi/Smart Contracts/Crypto].

We just built something you might find interesting: A smart contract that
guarantees 60% of revenue goes to pediatric charities. It's immutable,
verified on-chain, no trust required.

I think your audience would love the story:
- Technical angle: How backend systems enforce charity
- Philosophy angle: Why blockchain solves nonprofit problems
- Live demo: Show BaseScan verification in real-time

Would you be interested in a 15-20 min video collaboration?

I can provide:
- Technical deep-dive materials
- Pre-written script (adaptable)
- Demo access
- Sponsorship/payment if desired

Let me know!

**Template 3: Podcast Influencer (Relationship-building)**

```
Subject: Podcast Guest: "Why Crypto Enables Better Charity"

Hi [Host Name],

I've been listening to your podcast for [X months/years]. Your recent episode
on [relevant topic] was excellent.

We're building something I think your audience would appreciate: A Web3 platform
proving that blockchain creates MORE transparent, MORE accountable charitable
giving than traditional nonprofits.

Unlike traditional charities (20-30% overhead), our smart contract ensures 60%
reaches pediatric charities - verified on-chain.

Would you be interested in having me as a guest to discuss:
- Crypto's real-world impact (beyond trading speculation)
- How smart contracts solve accountability problems
- Why the best charities will be built on blockchain
- Live impact metrics + transparency

Happy to provide background materials, interview prep, etc.

Best,
Joshua Coleman
