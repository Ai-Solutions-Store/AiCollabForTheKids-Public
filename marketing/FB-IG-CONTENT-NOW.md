WE'RE LIVE ON KICKSTARTER! 🚀

After months of building in the shadows, we're finally ready to show you what we've been working on.

FOR THE KIDS isn't just another AI platform. It's a movement where every dollar spent actually means something.

Here's the deal:
✅ 60% of ALL revenue → Verified Pediatric Charities
✅ 30% → Platform Infrastructure & Growth
✅ 10% → Founder (Yes, just 10%)

This isn't charity with a side of business.
This is business BUILT ON charity.

We're building AI tools so powerful, you'd pay for them anyway.
The fact that 60% goes to sick kids? That's just who we are.

### FB POST 2: Founder Story
**Copy:**
```
Why would someone give 60% of their company to charity?

Let me tell you a story...

I'm Joshua Coleman. I built this platform nights and weekends while running a construction business. I've got more debt than sense and exactly zero outside investors.

So why give away 60%?

Because I spent years in hospitals with my own kids. I saw families bankrupted by medical bills. I saw parents choosing between mortgage payments and treatment.

And I thought: "What if businesses just... decided to be different?"

Not 1% pledges. Not "giving back."
What if giving was BUILT IN from day one?

So I wrote it into the code. Gospel V1.3 - immutable, permanent, non-negotiable.
60% to kids. Forever.

This Kickstarter funds our first year of operations. Every backer becomes part of something bigger than any of us.

Are you in?

### FB POST 3: Problem/Solution Framework
**Copy:**
```
THE AI INDUSTRY HAS A PROBLEM 👇

Everyone's racing to build the smartest AI.
Nobody's asking: "Who does this actually serve?"

Meanwhile:
• Big Tech rakes in billions
• Users are the product, not the customer
• Profits go to shareholders, not communities

We're doing it differently.

FOR THE KIDS builds enterprise-grade AI tools that actually solve problems:
✅ AI collaboration for teams
✅ Automated workflow orchestration
✅ Knowledge management that doesn't suck
✅ Real-time data intelligence

The difference?
60% of every dollar → Verified Pediatric Charities
Blockchain-verified. Publicly auditable. Permanent.

You get world-class AI tools.
Sick kids get world-class care.

Everybody wins except... well, nobody. Everybody wins.

**Copy:**
```
REAL STORY FROM OUR BETA TESTERS 👇

Sarah runs a 5-person marketing agency.
She was drowning in:
• Client briefs scattered across emails
• Missed deadlines from poor coordination
• Junior staff asking the same questions repeatedly

She tried Slack, Asana, Monday.com - nothing clicked.

Then she tried FOR THE KIDS.

Now:
✅ AI agent handles intake and organizes briefs
✅ Automated workflow tracking (zero missed deadlines)
✅ Knowledge base answers 80% of junior questions
✅ Her team saves 15+ hours/week

The ROI paid for itself in week one.

Oh, and 60% of her subscription feeds hungry kids.

She said: "I'd pay double just for the tools. The charity part makes me cry."

## PART 4: FACEBOOK GROUP INTRO TEMPLATES (3 VARIANTS)

### FB GROUP INTRO 1: Value-First Approach
```
Subject: AI Tools + Charity = This Should Exist More Often

Hey [Group Name]!

Long-time lurker, first-time poster. Hope this is okay with the mods - I think this might genuinely interest this community.

I'm Josh, and I built an AI collaboration platform called FOR THE KIDS. Here's why I'm sharing it here:

**What It Does:**
• AI-powered team collaboration (think Claude/ChatGPT but built for actual teamwork)
• Automated workflow orchestration
• Knowledge management that doesn't suck
• Real-time data intelligence

**Why It's Different:**
60% of ALL revenue goes to verified pediatric charities. Not "profits." Not "after expenses." Revenue. First dollar. Every dollar.

It's written into the code (Gospel V1.3) and published on the blockchain. Can't be changed, can't be voted out, can't be investor-negotiated.

**Why I'm Posting:**
We just launched on Kickstarter and I'd love your feedback. Even if you don't back it, your thoughts would help shape what we're building.

Early bird tier is $29/mo (lifetime pricing) vs $49 regular.

Kickstarter link: [URL]

Happy to answer any questions. And if this isn't appropriate for the group, I totally understand - just let me know and I'll delete.

Thanks for reading!
Josh

### FB GROUP INTRO 2: Story-First Approach
```
Subject: Built This Because I Got Tired of Watching Families Go Broke

Hey everyone,

Quick intro: I'm Josh. I run a construction company, have 3 kids, and spent more time in hospitals than I'd like.

I watched families financially destroyed by medical bills. Good people. Working people. People who did everything "right."

So I asked: What if businesses just... built charity in from day one?

Not 1% pledges. Not "giving back."
What if giving was THE POINT?

**I built FOR THE KIDS:**
• AI collaboration tools for teams
• 60% of revenue → Pediatric charities (Children's Miracle Network, St. Jude's, etc.)
• Blockchain-verified, publicly auditable, permanent

The split is called Gospel V1.3. It's coded into the platform. No board, investor, or future CEO can touch it.

We're live on Kickstarter. I'd be honored if you checked it out: [URL]

Even if you don't back it, sharing it helps. Feedback helps. Questions help.

Thanks for letting me share.

Josh

### FB GROUP INTRO 3: Question-First Approach
```
Subject: Quick Question: Would You Pay for AI Tools That Fund Charity?

Hey [Group Name],

Genuinely curious question for the group:

If there were AI collaboration tools (think project management + ChatGPT + team workflow automation) and 60% of the subscription went to pediatric charities...

Would you use it?

Context: I'm building this. It's called FOR THE KIDS.

**The Deal:**
• $29/mo for enterprise-grade AI tools
• $17.40 of that → Verified children's charities
• Blockchain-verified (you can audit every transaction)
• Gospel V1.3 = permanent 60/30/10 split (can't be changed)

We just launched on Kickstarter: [URL]

But honestly, I'm more interested in your feedback right now:

1. Would this model appeal to you?
2. What would make you trust it's legit?
3. What features would you need to switch from your current tools?

No pressure to back it - genuinely just want to hear from real people.

Thanks!
Josh

### AD VARIANT 3: Founder Story (Authenticity Play)

**HEADLINE:**
"I Gave 60% of My Company to Charity. Here's Why."

**PRIMARY TEXT:**
```
I'm Joshua Coleman. I built FOR THE KIDS nights and weekends while running a construction business.

Why give away 60%?

Years in hospitals with my kids showed me: families get destroyed by medical bills.

I thought: "What if business just decided to care?"

So I coded Gospel V1.3:
• 60% revenue → Pediatric charities
• 30% → Infrastructure
• 10% → Me (yes, really)

It's permanent. Blockchain-verified. Can't be changed.

FOR THE KIDS builds AI collaboration tools. Enterprise-grade. Actually useful.

You'd pay for the tools alone.
The 60% charity part? That's just who we are.

We're on Kickstarter right now.

Let's prove business can be better.
