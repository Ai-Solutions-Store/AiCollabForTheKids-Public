Hi Dr. [Name],

Pediatric dentists like you see over 200 million children annually in the US. You're
literally touching millions of lives.

What if there was a platform that helped you multiply that impact? Where your patients
could contribute to other children in crisis, and you'd earn commission for the referrals?

That's FOR THE KIDS.

Here's the deal:
- You recommend our platform to patients who ask about giving back
- They join, contribute, and 60% goes to verified pediatric charities
- You earn 5-10% commission on all referrals

And [Company] receives:
- 2% commission on all referred revenue

## CLOSING

The dental industry is uniquely positioned to scale FOR THE KIDS. Dentists see children every day. They already care about pediatric health. We're simply providing the infrastructure to transform that care into quantified community impact.

This isn't a charitable ask. It's a business partnership. Dentists win (commission, practice growth, mission alignment). Kids win (access to care). FOR THE KIDS wins (scale, revenue, impact).

**FOR THE KIDS. DENTISTS KNOW HOW.**
