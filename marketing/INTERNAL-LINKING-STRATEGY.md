# INTERNAL LINKING STRATEGY
## FOR THE KIDS Blog SEO Architecture
**Created:** December 17, 2025
**Goal:** Distribute authority, improve crawlability, increase pages/session to 2.5+
**Target:** 10,000+ monthly organic visitors with 2+ pages per session

---

## PILLAR CONTENT HUB MODEL

Our internal linking follows a "Pillar ? Cluster" architecture where:
- **Pillar Content** = 10 foundational long-form guides (3,500-5,000 words)
- **Cluster Content** = 20 supporting articles (1,500-2,000 words) that link back to pillars
- **Supporting Resources** = 30 tactical how-tos and tutorials (1,000-1,500 words)

This structure:
1. Concentrates ranking power around key pillars
2. Distributes authority throughout the entire site
3. Creates natural user journeys (entry ? deep dive ? conversion)
4. Reduces orphan pages and improves site architecture

## INTERNAL LINKING RULES & BEST PRACTICES

### RULE 1: EVERY PILLAR LINKS TO 3-5 SUPPORTING POSTS

**Linking Pattern:**
```
Pillar Content (3,500-5,000 words)
+- Link to Related Supporting #1 (mid-content, context-specific)
+- Link to Related Supporting #2 (mid-content, different aspect)
+- Link to Tutorial Supporting (mid-to-bottom, "how-to" readers)
+- Link to Case Study Supporting (bottom section)
+- "Continue Reading" or "Related Resources" section (3-5 links)
```

**Example from Pillar 1 (Smart Contract):**
- Paragraph 3: "How to verify our allocation" ? Link to Supporting Post 27
- Paragraph 7: "Code implementation details" ? Link to Supporting Post 15
- Paragraph 10: "COPPA compliance" ? Link to Supporting Post 16
- Conclusion: "Ready to deploy your own?" ? Link to Supporting Post 30
- Bottom: "Related Resources" box with 3-5 links

---

### RULE 2: EVERY SUPPORTING POST LINKS BACK TO RELEVANT PILLAR

**At minimum, 1-2 references per supporting post:**
- Intro: Establish context, link to pillar (1 link)
- Mid-content: Deeper explanation, link to pillar (1 link if relevant)
- Conclusion: "Learn more in our complete guide" (1 link)

**Example from Supporting Post 15 (Code Walkthrough):**
- Intro: "As detailed in [our smart contract guide](#)"
- Line-by-line code: "This function implements the allocation logic [described in our guide](#)"
- Conclusion: "For the big picture, see [our complete smart contract guide](#)"

---

### RULE 3: NATURAL ANCHOR TEXT (NOT "CLICK HERE")

**Good Anchor Text:**
- "our smart contract charity guide"
- "complete guide to blockchain transparency"
- "60/30/10 profit allocation model"
- "how to read a smart contract on BaseScan"

**Bad Anchor Text:**
- "click here"
- "read more"
- "this post"
- "link"

**Best Practice:** Anchor text includes the target keyword or a clear description of where it leads.

---

### RULE 4: CONTEXTUAL LINKING (NO RANDOM LINKS)

Every internal link must make sense in context. The reader should understand why they're being linked to that content.

**Good Example:**
"The smart contract automatically divides revenue 60% to charities, 30% to infrastructure, and 10% to the founder. [Learn more about this 60/30/10 model and why we chose it](#)."

**Bad Example:**
"Smart contracts are great. [Check out our blog](#)."

---

### RULE 5: LINK DEPTH LIMIT OF 3 CLICKS

No page should be more than 3 clicks from the homepage.

**Hierarchy:**
- **Depth 1:** Homepage
- **Depth 2:** Pillar posts (direct from homepage)
- **Depth 3:** Supporting posts (from pillars or homepage)
- **Depth 4 (avoid):** Nested tutorial pages

**Exception:** Blog archive pages can be depth 4 if linked from multiple depth 3 pages.

---

## STRATEGIC LINKING TOPOLOGY

### LINK TYPE 1: VERTICAL LINKING (Pillar ? Cluster)
**Purpose:** Distribute authority downward, create topic silos

**Implementation:**
- Pillar post links to 3-5 supporting articles
- Supporting articles link back to 1 pillar
- Ratio: 3:1 (pillar gets 3 inbound, 1 outbound)

**SEO Benefit:** Pillar accumulates authority from cluster links

---

### LINK TYPE 2: HORIZONTAL LINKING (Pillar ? Pillar)
**Purpose:** Create topic bridges, enable cross-cluster navigation

**Implementation:**
- Pillar 1 (Smart Contracts) ? Pillar 2 (Social Enterprise)
- Pillar 3 (Blockchain) ? Pillar 5 (60/30/10 Model)
- Reference: "As explained in our [social enterprise guide](#)"

**Locations:**
- Intro section (context setting)
- Conclusion section (related topics)
- Mid-content (only if truly relevant)

**Limit:** Max 2-3 horizontal links per pillar (avoid dilution)

---

### LINK TYPE 3: FOOTER LINKING (Homepage Strategy)
**Purpose:** Ensure every pillar is accessible from homepage

**Implementation:**
```html
<footer>
  <h4>CORE RESOURCES</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/blog/smart-contract-charity-guide">Smart Contract Charity Guide</a></li>
    <li><a href="/blog/what-is-social-enterprise">What is a Social Enterprise?</a></li>
    <li><a href="/blog/blockchain-charity-transparency">Blockchain Transparency Guide</a></li>
    <li><a href="/blog/AI-fundraising-platform">AI Fundraising Platform</a></li>
    <li><a href="/blog/60-30-10-profit-split-model">60/30/10 Business Model</a></li>
  </ul>
</footer>
```

**SEO Benefit:** Every page flows authority to these 10 pillars

---

### LINK TYPE 4: SIDEBAR LINKING ("Related Posts")
**Purpose:** Increase pages per session, reduce bounce rate

**Implementation:**
Each blog post sidebar contains:
- **3-5 related posts** (from same cluster)
- Matching keyword intent
- Different content type (if pillar, show supporting; if supporting, show pillar)

**Example Sidebar (Smart Contract Pillar):**
```
RELATED POSTS
1. planned smart contract (backend enforcement active) Walkthrough (Deep Dive)
2. How to Read BaseScan (Tutorial)
3. COPPA Compliance in AI (Related Tech)
```

**CTA:** "Read Related Posts" link at end of article

---

### LINK TYPE 5: BREADCRUMB LINKING
**Purpose:** Help users understand site architecture

**Implementation:**
```
Home > Blog > Blockchain > Smart Contract Charity
```

**Schema Markup:**
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://aidoesitall.website/"},
    {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "Blog", "item": "https://aidoesitall.website/blog/"},
    {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 3, "name": "Smart Contract Charity Guide", "item": "https://aidoesitall.website/blog/smart-contract-charity-guide"}
  ]
}
```
