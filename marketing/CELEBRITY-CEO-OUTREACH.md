**Version 2 (Technical)**:
```
[Name] - AI ethics question for you:

Can backend systems enforce charitable allocation better than traditional nonprofits?

We're proving it: 60% AI revenue ? kids. Base contract: 0x9855...965A4

Claude ensures compliance. 396K children helped.

Thoughts? Would love your take.
```

**Version 3 (Founder Story)**:
```
[Name], founder story you might appreciate:

I took a 10% cut (instead of 20%) so 60% could go to Verified Pediatric Charities.

AI platform enforced by smart contracts. Claude/Gemini ensure it never changes.

Sound interesting? Let's talk.

FOR THE KIDS.

## 8. HANDLING OBJECTIONS & FAQs

### OBJECTION: "Is this a charity?"
**RESPONSE**:
"No - we're a for-profit LLC. We provide AI services and allocate 60% of revenue to Verified Pediatric Charities through smart contracts. Think of it like TOMS Shoes (buy one, give one) but with transparent blockchain proof."

### OBJECTION: "Is this ?"
**RESPONSE**:
"No - customers are purchasing AI services, not making contributions. The charitable allocation happens on our end through profit-sharing. We don't claim to offer tax deductions."

### OBJECTION: "How do I know the money actually goes to kids?"
**RESPONSE**:
"Smart contract on Base blockchain: Planned (Q1 2026). Every allocation is publicly verifiable. Claude AI ensures codebase compliance. We also publish quarterly transparency reports."

### OBJECTION: "Why should I trust you?"
**RESPONSE**:
"Fair question. That's why we built it Transparent:
1. Backend system enforces split (can't be changed)
2. AI (Claude) audits all code changes
3. Public blockchain proof
4. Open to third-party audits

You don't have to trust us - trust the math."

### OBJECTION: "60% seems too high - how do you stay in business?"
**RESPONSE**:
"30% covers infrastructure, APIs, servers. 10% covers founder salary. It's tight, but sustainable. We're proving you don't need 60%+ profit margins to build valuable tech. The mission is the moat."

### OBJECTION: "What if you go out of business?"
**RESPONSE**:
"Smart contract funds are held in DAO treasury. If we shut down, remaining funds still go to designated charities per Gospel rules. The kids are protected even if we fail."

### OBJECTION: "Are you using this for PR/marketing?"
**RESPONSE**:
"Yes - and we're transparent about it. The 60% allocation is both mission AND marketing. We think that's better than greenwashing. We're actually doing it, with proof."
