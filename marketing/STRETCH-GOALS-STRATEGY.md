# FOR THE KIDS - KICKSTARTER STRETCH GOALS STRATEGY

**Gospel V1.3 Compliance: 60% Charity / 30% Infrastructure / 10% Founder**

## STRETCH GOAL PHILOSOPHY

### Core Principles

**What Makes Great Charity Platform Stretch Goals:**

1. **Direct Impact Multiplier** - Each goal increases help to kids
2. **Visible Progress** - Backers see exactly what their support unlocks
3. **Community Building** - Goals that bring more people into the mission
4. **Sustainable Growth** - Infrastructure to serve MORE kids, not just more features
5. **Story-Worthy Moments** - Each unlock generates shareable content

**Key Rules:**
- Every stretch goal MUST increase charitable impact
- 60% of ALL additional funds go to kids (Gospel V1.3 immutable)
- Goals should be achievable but aspirational
- Each tier unlocks something BIGGER than the last
- Community should feel ownership of unlocked goals

### Anti-Patterns (What We DON'T Do)

❌ "Luxury" features that don't help kids
❌ Founder perks or salary increases
❌ Cosmetic upgrades
❌ Goals that delay helping kids
✅ **More charities, more kids, more impact**

## TIMING STRATEGY: When to Reveal Each Goal

### Phase 1: Campaign Launch (Day 1-3)
**Reveal:** Tier 1 ($25K) + Tier 2 ($50K)
- These are "achievable excitement" goals
- Create immediate momentum
- Show backers there's more to unlock

### Phase 2: Early Momentum (Day 4-7)
**Reveal:** Tier 3 ($100K)
- Wait until Tier 1 is unlocked OR we hit 40% of Tier 1
- Don't reveal too early - kills motivation
- Announce with fanfare: "NEW STRETCH GOAL REVEALED!"

### Phase 3: Mid-Campaign (Week 2)
**Reveal:** Tier 4 ($250K)
- Only if we've hit $50K or are trending toward $100K
- Creates "this is bigger than we thought" narrative
- Press coverage opportunity: "Kickstarter Exceeds Expectations"

### Phase 4: Final Week (Last 7 Days)
**Reveal:** Tier 5 ($500K)
- Final push momentum
- "Last chance to unlock documentary"
- Creates FOMO for fence-sitters

### Phase 5: Final 48 Hours (Emergency Only)
**Reveal:** Tier 6 ($1M)
- ONLY if we're trending toward $500K+
- "Surprise final stretch goal!"
- Nuclear option to drive final-hour pledges

### Golden Rule:
**NEVER reveal a goal we're not trending toward.**
- If we're at $30K on Day 10, DON'T reveal $250K goal
- Better to add NEW goals in response to momentum
- Community wants to feel achievable, not impossible

## FINAL THOUGHTS: MOMENTUM PSYCHOLOGY

### Why Stretch Goals Work

1. **Continuous Motivation:** Backers don't "finish" supporting
2. **FOMO Amplification:** Late pledgers want to unlock goals
3. **Social Proof:** "10K people unlocked this, I should join"
4. **Story Arc:** Campaign has narrative structure, not flatline
5. **Community Victory:** Shared achievement bonds backers

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Revealing all goals at launch** → No surprises, kills momentum
❌ **Goals too easy** → Boring, no challenge
❌ **Goals too hard** → Demotivating, "we'll never hit it"
❌ **Unrelated goals** → "Why are we adding socks?" (must relate to mission)
❌ **No celebration** → Backers feel unappreciated

✅ **Gradual reveal** → Maintain mystery and excitement
✅ **Goldilocks difficulty** → Achievable but aspirational
✅ **Mission-aligned** → Every goal helps more kids
✅ **Celebrate HARD** → Make backers feel like heroes

---

## GOSPEL V1.3 COMPLIANCE CHECK

**Revenue Split for All Stretch Goals:**
- 60% to verified pediatric charities
- 30% to infrastructure (platform development, servers, staff)
- 10% to founder

**Example: $1M Campaign Success**
- $600,000 → Charities (St. Jude, SickKids, CHOP, etc.)
- $300,000 → Infrastructure (mobile apps, Canada expansion, kiosks, etc.)
- $100,000 → Founder (salary + seed for next phase)

**Transparency Commitment:**
Every stretch goal announcement MUST include: "60% to kids. Always."
