## First Comment (Draft)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built AI Does It All because I wanted AI tools that actually DO something meaningful with the money they generate.

**The Split (Gospel V1.3 - Immutable):**
- 60% → Verified pediatric charities
- 30% → Operations & development
- 10% → DAO treasury for community governance

**What You Get:**
- $1 AI consultation to start
- $9.99 starter pack for full access
- Enterprise solutions available

This isn't charity-washing. The split is hardcoded and audited. Every transaction, every time.

Would love your feedback on how we can make this better. What AI tools would help YOU while helping kids?

FOR THE KIDS. 🧒
