### Email 2: Day 7 Check-In (If No Activity Yet)

Hi [First Name],

It's been a week since you joined the affiliate program!

I noticed you haven't shared your link yet. No judgment—sometimes
people just need a little push or clarity on how to get started.

I want to unblock you. Here are three fast ways to get your first referral:

OPTION 1: SHARE WITH YOUR EMAIL LIST (Fastest)
If you have an email list, this is the fastest. Most affiliates
get their first conversion within 24 hours of sending an email.

Copy/paste template from your dashboard:
[TEMPLATE LINK]

OPTION 2: POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA (Easiest)
Twitter, LinkedIn, or Facebook. Pre-written posts are in your dashboard.
Pick one, click "share," and it goes out.

Most viral post: "I joined FOR THE KIDS affiliate program.
60% of what I earn goes to children's hospitals. Join me: [link]"

OPTION 3: TELL A FRIEND DIRECTLY (Most Personal)
Text 3 people you know who use AI tools. Example:

"Hey! I found this AI platform that's awesome AND 60% goes to kids' hospitals.
Wanted you to check it out: [link]"

WHAT TOP PERFORMERS DO:
→ Share once per week (consistency beats quantity)
→ Mix channels (email + social + direct)
→ Focus on value, not sales ("This saved me 10 hours/week" not "Buy this")
→ Use their honest story (most effective)

QUICK FACT:
Affiliates who share their link within 7 days earn 5x more in Year 1.

Let me help. Reply with:
1. What's your biggest audience? (Email list? Social media? Podcast?)
2. What use case do you have? (Content creation? Business automation?)

I'll send you the perfect template for your situation.

   LinkedIn: "Excited to announce I'm an affiliate partner with @AiCollabKids,

**Preview:** Simple action to start earning again

---

**Body:**

```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed you haven't shared your referral link in about a month.

No judgment—life happens. But I wanted to check in because:

1. You're leaving money on the table
2. Every day without referrals means fewer kids helped
3. Getting started again is easier than starting fresh

HERE'S A QUICK WIN:

Instead of a massive campaign, do ONE simple thing this week:

OPTION 1: Send one email to your list
Template: [TEMPLATE LINK]
Time: 5 minutes
Expected result: 2-5 sign-ups

OPTION 2: Post one social post
Template: [SOCIAL TEMPLATE]
Time: 1 minute
Expected result: 1-2 sign-ups

OPTION 3: Tell one friend directly
Template: [DM TEMPLATE]
Time: 30 seconds
Expected result: 1 sign-up

Any of these could earn you $10-50 in commission.

WHAT CHANGED:

New features since you were last active:
- Leaderboards (real-time tracking, see who's #1)
- Gamification rewards (badges, points, tiers)
- Monthly challenges (team competitions, extra bonuses)
- Merchandise rewards (t-shirts, hoodies earned with points)

Your dashboard now shows [Tier Name] tier benefits worth
$[VALUE]/month in credits.

Let's get you back on track.

Just one action. Today.
