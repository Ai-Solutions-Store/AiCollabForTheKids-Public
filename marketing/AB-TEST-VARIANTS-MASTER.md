## TESTING METHODOLOGY

### Statistical Requirements

**Minimum Sample Size per Variant:**
- Landing page tests: 500 visitors per variant
- Email tests: 1,000 recipients per variant
- Ad tests: 200 clicks per variant
- CTA tests: 300 interactions per variant

**Confidence Level:** 95% (p < 0.05)
**Minimum Detectable Effect:** 10% relative improvement
**Test Duration:** Minimum 7 days OR sample size reached (whichever comes first)
**Traffic Split:** Equal allocation across variants (e.g., 50/50 for 2 variants)

### Testing Tools Stack

**Primary Platform:** Google Optimize (free, integrates with Analytics)
**Backup:** VWO or Optimizely (if budget allows)
**Email Testing:** Built into Mailchimp/SendGrid
**Analytics:** Google Analytics 4 + Mixpanel for funnel analysis
**Heatmaps:** Hotjar or Microsoft Clarity (free)

### Test Prioritization Framework (PIE Score)

Rate each test on scale 1-10:
- **P**otential: How much improvement is possible?
- **I**mportance: How valuable is the traffic/page?
- **E**ase: How easy is it to implement?

**PIE Score = (P + I + E) / 3**

Run highest PIE score tests first.

### Winner Declaration Criteria

A variant wins when:
1. ✅ Reaches statistical significance (95% confidence)
2. ✅ Maintains improvement for minimum 7 days
3. ✅ Shows consistent performance across segments (mobile/desktop)
4. ✅ Passes "sanity check" (makes logical sense)

**NEVER** call a winner early. False positives damage long-term optimization.

you're not just getting powerful AI—you're giving hope to kids
fighting for their futures. Join us in building something
beautiful.
```

---

### Angle 2: Urgency & Action

**Tone:** Time-sensitive, decisive, immediate impact
**Language Examples:**
- "Kids need help today, not tomorrow"
- "Every minute counts"
- "Limited time to join founding backers"
- "Your action creates immediate impact"

```
Right now, children's hospitals are operating on thin margins.
Right now, families are struggling to afford treatment. Your
backing today puts money in their hands this month—not someday.
60% goes directly to verified charities within 30 days. The
time to act is now.
```

- "Full transparency, full control"
- "Track every dollar in real-time"

```
You're in control. Choose from our verified charity partners.
Watch your contributions in real-time on the blockchain.
Download your impact reports anytime. This isn't a black box—
it's your giving, fully visible. You deserve to know exactly
where your money goes. Now you will.

Let's be honest: most "socially responsible" companies are full
of it. "Portion of proceeds" usually means 2%. "Giving back"
means a PR photoshoot once a year. We're calling BS. 60% goes

**Reddit Variant A: Authentic Founder AMA-Style**

**Title:** "I'm building an AI platform that gives 60% to kids' hospitals (smart contract enforced). AMA"

**Text:**
```
Hey r/entrepreneur,

I'm Joshua, founder of FOR THE KIDS. After 14 years in tech,
I got tired of "socially responsible" companies that give 2%
to charity once a year for PR.

So I built an AI platform where 60% of revenue goes to
pediatric charities. Locked it in a smart contract so I can't
change my mind. Public ledger so you can audit me.

We just launched on Kickstarter. Happy to answer any questions
about the tech, the business model, or why I'm "crazy" enough
to give away 60%.

[Link to Kickstarter]
```

**Tone:** Conversational, humble, transparent

---

**Reddit Variant B: Problem-Solution for r/technology**

**Title:** "We built a transparent charity platform using smart contracts. Here's what we learned."

**Text:**
```
Charity fraud is a $billions problem. "Portion of proceeds"
usually means 2%. supporters have no idea where money actually goes.

We solved it with Ethereum smart contracts:
- 60/30/10 split enforced by code
- Public transaction ledger (anyone can audit)
- Multi-sig treasury (no single point of failure)
- Real-time dashboard showing every contribution

Open-sourcing the smart contracts next month. Kickstarter live now.

Technical deep-dive in comments.
```

**Tone:** Technical, credible, education-focused

---

**Reddit Variant C: For r/philanthropy**

**Title:** "Is 60% the new standard? Our experiment in radical giving."

**Text:**
```
Most platforms give 5-10% to charity. We're giving 60%.

Not because we're saints. Because the math works:
- Lower margins force efficiency
- Mission attracts loyal customers
- Transparency builds trust = lower acquisition costs
- Smart contract enforcement = credibility

3 months in, we've contributed $500K+ to St. Jude, Children's
Miracle Network, and other verified orgs.

What if 60% became the expectation, not the exception?

**Tone:** Thought leadership, data-driven, inspiring

---

## RAPID TESTING PROTOCOLS

### When to Call a Test Early

**ONLY call a test before reaching sample size/duration if:**
1. One variant is causing technical errors
2. One variant has 99%+ confidence AND 60%+ improvement
3. One variant is actively damaging brand (negative feedback)

**Otherwise: Let it run.** Early stopping inflates false positives.

---

### When to Extend a Test

**Extend testing if:**
1. Results are borderline (90-94% confidence)
2. Variants are within 5% of each other (too close to call)
3. Mobile vs. desktop show opposite winners (need segmentation)
4. Weekday vs. weekend traffic behaves differently

**Add 60% more sample size and re-evaluate.**

---

### When to Abandon a Test

**Abandon if:**
1. No variant reaches 80% confidence after 3x expected duration
2. All variants perform worse than control (implementation bug likely)
3. External factors change (major news event, site redesign, etc.)

**Document learnings and move on.**

---

## SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS

### Always Analyze Winners by Segment

**Required Segments:**
- **Device:** Mobile vs. Desktop vs. Tablet
- **Traffic Source:** Organic vs. Paid vs. Social vs. Email
- **New vs. Returning:** First-time visitors vs. returning
- **Geography:** US vs. International (if applicable)
- **Time:** Weekday vs. Weekend

**If winner only works for one segment:** Consider serving different variants by segment.

**Example:**
- Mobile users prefer short-form landing page
- Desktop users prefer long-form with detailed explanation
- **Solution:** Serve different layouts based on device detection

---

## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Before Launching a Test

- [ ] Hypothesis clearly stated
- [ ] Success metric defined (primary KPI)
- [ ] Minimum sample size calculated
- [ ] Test duration estimated
- [ ] Variants built and QA'd
- [ ] Analytics tracking verified
- [ ] Mobile responsive check passed
- [ ] Test documented in tracking sheet

### During Test

- [ ] Monitor daily for technical issues
- [ ] Check for sample size imbalances (50/50 split maintained)
- [ ] Review qualitative feedback (comments, support tickets)
- [ ] Resist urge to peek at results before completion

### After Test

- [ ] Statistical significance verified
- [ ] Segmentation analysis completed
- [ ] Winner implemented site-wide
- [ ] Loser variants deactivated
- [ ] Results documented
- [ ] Team notified of learnings
- [ ] Follow-up tests planned

---

## GOSPEL V1.3 COMPLIANCE IN TESTING

**CRITICAL:** All test variants MUST reflect:
- **60%** to charity (not 60%)
- **30%** to infrastructure
- **10%** to founder (not 20%)
- Gospel **V1.3** (not V1.2)

**Pre-Launch Checklist:**
- [ ] All headlines mention "60%" not "60%"
- [ ] All pie charts show 60/30/10 split
- [ ] All copy references Gospel V1.3
- [ ] All founder mentions state "10% to founder"

**Zero tolerance for outdated splits in live tests.**

---

## FINAL TESTING PHILOSOPHY

### Test Fast, Test Often

**Velocity beats perfection.**
- Better to run 10 tests at 90% certainty than 1 test at 100%
- Small improvements compound (5% + 5% + 5% = 15.7% total)
- Learning from losses is as valuable as learning from wins

### Respect the Data

**Don't rationalize away results you don't like.**
- If "ugly" design wins, ship ugly design
- If short copy outperforms long, go short
- Your intuition is a hypothesis, not a truth

### Always Be Testing

**Optimization never ends.**
- Last year's winner is this year's control
- Audience preferences evolve
- Continuous improvement is the only moat

---

## FOR THE KIDS - ALWAYS

Every test, every optimization, every conversion...
60% goes to children who need it.

**Test relentlessly. Optimize constantly. Give generously.**
