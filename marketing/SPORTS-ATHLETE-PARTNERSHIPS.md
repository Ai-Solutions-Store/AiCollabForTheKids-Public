This isn't about celebrity. It's about scale. One athlete can reach millions. That reach, multiplied by 50 athletes, 30 teams, 100 youth organizations, and 50 podcasts creates a cultural moment where sports and giving become inseparable.

By the end of 2026, the sports world will know: FOR THE KIDS is where champions support children.

**Athletes love helping kids. This strategy makes that instinct profitable�for the kids.**
