---

## DOCUMENT 2: COMMUNITY-INTRO-TEMPLATES.md

**What It Is:** Customizable intro messages for different community types.

**Structure:**
- Tier 1 templates (6 detailed examples)
- Tier 2 templates (2 detailed examples)
- Universal response templates (for common questions)
- Gospel V1.3 compliance checklist

**Template Categories:**
1. Effective Altruism & Giving Communities
2. Indie Hackers / Founder Communities
3. Tech/AI Developer Communities
4. Parenting Communities
5. Healthcare Professional Communities
6. Social Enterprise / Impact Investors

**Key Features:**
- Each template shows tone, best channels, expected questions/answers

- Tax deduction, verification, charity partnership FAQ answers
- Gospel V1.3 compliance for every message

**How to Use:**
1. Pick your first community from Tier 1 list

3. Customize with your specific story/data
4. Don't copy-paste - adapt to specific community culture
5. Include campaign URL naturally
6. Be ready for responses

**Key Insight:**
Lead with value and mission - never lead with "buy my stuff." Platform gets mentioned after you've earned credibility.

---

## DOCUMENT 3: COMMUNITY-VALUE-FIRST-STRATEGY.md

**What It Is:** Philosophy and tactical playbook for building trust before asking for anything.

**Core Framework:**
- 80/20/10 rule: 8 value messages, 2 mission messages, 1 soft ask per 10 posts
- 5-phase engagement ladder (Observer → Thought Leader → Evangelist)
- 30-60-90 day progression plan

**Detailed Value Plays by Community:**
- How to demonstrate expertise in EA communities
- Transparent founder metrics in Indie Hackers
- Technical execution in developer communities
- Authentic parenting in parenting communities
- Professional expertise in healthcare communities

**Key Concepts:**
- Value ladder: Different engagement level for each phase of community involvement
- The 30-60-90: Build credibility → demonstrate expertise → activate evangelism
- Response playbooks for different scenarios

**How to Use:**
1. Read the 5-phase engagement ladder before joining any community
2. Reference it weekly to assess where you are in each community
3. Use the value plays when planning your monthly content
4. Track metrics to see if your engagement is progressing as expected
5. Adjust community strategy based on progression rate

**Key Insight:**
Slow growth beats fast burn. Better to have 20 true advocates than 200 skeptics. Communities detect inauthenticity from a mile away.

## DOCUMENT 4: OWN-DISCORD-SERVER-SETUP.md

**What It Is:** Complete guide to creating your own Discord server as the community hub.

**Phases:**
1. **Phase 1 (Days 1-7):** Foundation - server setup, channels, theme
2. **Phase 2 (Days 7-14):** Roles & moderation - build governance structure
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 2-4):** Content & engagement - establish cadence
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 3+):** Community events - office hours, discussions, challenges
5. **Phase 5 (Ongoing):** Convert to movement - empower evangelists, scale

**Channel Structure:**
- Welcome category (introduction + rules)
- Mission & Values (Gospel V1.3, impact tracking, announcements)
- Community (general, wins, ideas, partnerships)
- Builders (feedback, bugs, integrations)
- Resources (guides, charities, reading)
- Admin (moderation, internal)

**Key Features:**
- Role system (Founder, Moderator, Evangelist, Charity Partner, Builder)
- Moderation guidelines (what warrants removal, warning, conversation)
- Content calendar (daily, weekly, monthly posts)
- Community event ideas (office hours, debates, challenges)
- Growth metrics to track

**How to Use:**
1. Follow Phase 1 checklist to launch server this week
2. Post Phase 1-2 content (welcome, gospel explanation, moderation rules)
3. Invite 10-15 early advocates from other communities
4. Follow Phase 3 content calendar religiously
5. By week 4, you should have 50+ active members and visible culture
6. Use Phase 4 events to deepen engagement

**Key Insight:**
Your Discord becomes the command center where evangelists gather and community becomes movement. It's not the product sales channel - it's the gospel embassy.

## DOCUMENT FILE PATHS

All documents in: `C:\AiCollabForTheKids\marketing\`

1. **COMMUNITY-PRIORITY-LIST.md** - Which communities, in order, with why
2. **COMMUNITY-INTRO-TEMPLATES.md** - How to introduce yourself authentically
3. **COMMUNITY-VALUE-FIRST-STRATEGY.md** - Philosophy of building trust without asking
4. **OWN-DISCORD-SERVER-SETUP.md** - How to build your community hub

---

## COMMON QUESTIONS

**"Should I start with my own Discord or external communities?"**
Both at once. Your Discord is the hub; external communities are recruitment. They feed each other.

**"How many hours/week does this take?"**
Month 1: 8-10 hours/week (active launch)
Month 2: 6-8 hours/week (maintain + expand)
Month 3+: 4-6 hours/week (ongoing engagement)

**"What if a community doesn't respond to me?"**
Move on. Different communities have different cultures. Better to invest in responsive ones.

**"How do I know if it's working?"**
Track signups by community source. If Indie Hackers brings 5 signups, but EA Discord brings 15, you know where to focus.

**"What about negative feedback about Gospel V1.3?"**
Welcome it. If someone can poke holes, you fix it. That makes Gospel stronger, not weaker.

**"Can I use the same message in multiple communities?"**
No. Customize for each community's tone. Copy-paste = instant credibility loss.

## FINAL WORDS

You have everything you need to build FOR THE KIDS from unknown startup to community-driven movement.

The strategy is simple:
1. Join real communities authentically
2. Provide value before asking for anything
3. Build your own community as hub
4. Let evangelists do the work
5. Gospel V1.3 becomes their belief

It's not fast. It's not easy. But it's sustainable.

Communities built this way don't just buy once - they evangelize forever.

Go build.
