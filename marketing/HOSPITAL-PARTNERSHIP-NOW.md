## 1. LETTER TO HOSPITAL CEO/CFO

**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity: AI-Powered Fundraising Platform with 60% Revenue Share

```
[Hospital Letterhead Address]
[Date]

Dear [CEO/CFO Name],

I'm reaching out to introduce FOR THE KIDS, a next-generation fundraising platform that could significantly amplify [Hospital Name]'s funding capacity while maintaining your institution's complete operational independence.

THE OPPORTUNITY

FOR THE KIDS is an AI-powered collaboration platform where 60% of ALL revenue flows directly to verified pediatric charities through transparent blockchain infrastructure. Unlike traditional fundraising models that charge 5-15% fees, we've inverted the model entirely.

Our unique value proposition:
• 60% of platform revenue to pediatric charities (Gospel V1.3)
• Blockchain-verified transparent fund distribution
• AI-powered donor engagement and matching
• Zero traditional fundraising fees for participating hospitals
• Co-branded campaigns that amplify your existing donor relationships

WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT

Most platforms take a cut. We give the majority. Our founder, Joshua Coleman, restructured the entire revenue model (Gospel V1.3 Ethics Override) to ensure kids receive the maximum benefit:

60% → Verified Pediatric Charities (YOU)
30% → Platform Infrastructure & Growth
10% → Founder

This isn't charity. This is engineered generosity at scale.

THE ASK

I'd like to schedule a 30-minute call to discuss:
1. How [Hospital Name] can become a verified charity recipient
2. Co-branded campaign opportunities for Q1 2026
3. Technical integration with your existing donor systems
4. Transparency reporting and blockchain verification

PROOF POINTS

• Platform built on enterprise-grade infrastructure (AWS, Cloudflare)
• Full SOC 2 Type II compliance pathway in progress
• Smart contract audits by [Auditor Name - pending]
• Existing partnerships with [Early Partners - TBD]

[Hospital Name] does extraordinary work saving children's lives. We've built infrastructure to ensure more funding flows to that mission, faster and more transparently than ever before.

Would you be available for a brief call the week of [Date]? I'm happy to work around your schedule.

For the Kids, Always.

P.S. - Our entire revenue model is open-source and blockchain-verified. Every transaction is auditable. I'm happy to provide our technical architecture documentation and smart contract code before our call.

## 2. LETTER TO CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL FOUNDATION DIRECTOR

**Subject:** AI-Powered Donor Engagement Platform - Partnership Proposal

```
[Foundation Letterhead Address]
[Date]

Dear [Foundation Director Name],

As someone who manages donor relationships and fundraising campaigns daily, you know the challenges: donor fatigue, platform fees eating into contributions, and the constant need to prove impact transparency.

I've built something specifically designed to solve these problems.

THE PLATFORM

FOR THE KIDS is an AI-powered fundraising platform where 60% of ALL platform revenue flows directly to pediatric charities like [Hospital Foundation Name]. Not 60% of donations - 60% of EVERYTHING we earn.

Here's what that means for your foundation:

REVENUE STREAMS YOU RECEIVE 60% OF:
• Subscription fees (Pro/Enterprise AI collaboration tools)
• Merchandise sales (co-branded hospital merchandise)
• Event ticket sales (virtual and in-person fundraisers)
• Corporate partnership fees
• Premium feature upgrades

You receive 60% of all of this. Automatically. Monthly. Via blockchain-verified smart contracts.

CO-BRANDED CAMPAIGN OPPORTUNITIES

Imagine launching:
• "[Hospital Name] AI Learning Lab" - Families collaborate on AI projects, proceeds split 60/40
• "Code for [City] Kids" - Tech community hackathons benefiting your hospital
• "[Hospital Name] Merch Store" - Co-branded apparel with 60% to your foundation
• "Virtual Gala Powered by FOR THE KIDS" - Online events with zero platform fees

Each campaign is:
✓ Fully branded to your hospital
✓ Integrated with your existing donor CRM
✓ Blockchain-transparent for donor confidence
✓ AI-optimized for maximum engagement

DONOR CONFIDENCE & TRANSPARENCY

Your donors can verify, in real-time:
• Exact percentage flowing to your foundation (60%)
• Transaction history on public blockchain
• Impact metrics tied to specific campaigns
• Zero hidden fees or deductions

This isn't a promise. It's mathematically enforced by smart contracts.

THE TECHNICAL INTEGRATION

We integrate with:
• Salesforce Nonprofit Cloud
• Blackbaud Raiser's Edge
• Classy fundraising platform
• Custom donor databases via API

Implementation timeline: 2-4 weeks
Cost to your foundation: $0
Revenue share: 60% to you, automatically

NEXT STEPS

I'd love to schedule a 45-minute demo where I can show you:
1. Live dashboard showing real-time fund distribution
2. Co-branded campaign mockups for [Hospital Name]
3. Donor engagement AI tools
4. Technical integration roadmap

Are you available for a call the week of [Date]? I'm in [Time Zone] but happy to accommodate your schedule.

Your foundation does incredible work. Let's amplify it.

For the Kids, Always.
