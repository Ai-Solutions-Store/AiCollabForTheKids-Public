# CHARITY RUN EVENT CONCEPT
## FOR THE KIDS - "Every Mile Matters"

**Prepared:** December 17, 2025
**Mission:** 60% of all revenue to Verified Pediatric Charities (Gospel V1.3)
**Campaign URL:** https://aidoesitall.website
**Revenue Target:** $500K-$1M annually from run events

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Running is a sport built on community, perseverance, and heart. Runners inherently understand what it means to push beyond limits, to overcome obstacles, and to achieve the impossible. These same qualities are what sick and injured children need—determination to heal, community support, and the belief that they can overcome their medical challenges.

The FOR THE KIDS Charity Run Event Concept positions running events as fundraising mechanisms for pediatric hospitals while celebrating human achievement. Every 5K, every marathon, every training run becomes a vehicle for pediatric care funding.

**Key Insight:** Runners want their miles to matter. FOR THE KIDS gives their miles direct, measurable impact on children's lives.

## CONCLUSION

The FOR THE KIDS Charity Run Event Concept transforms running from a personal achievement into a communal force for good. Every mile run, every race completed, every training session becomes part of a movement where human determination directly translates into pediatric care funding.

Running events are about inspiring people to achieve the impossible. FOR THE KIDS channels that inspiration toward inspiring hope in children facing medical hardship.

Every finish line is a victory. Every dollar raised is a child's second chance.

**Runners Go the Distance for Kids. FOR THE KIDS.**
