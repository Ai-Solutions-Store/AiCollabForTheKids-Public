## SECTION 2: PODCAST PITCH EMAIL TEMPLATES

### UNIVERSAL TEMPLATE (Customize for Each Show)

```
Subject: [Unique Angle Specific to Their Audience] - Guest Pitch

Hi [Host Name],

I'm Joshua Coleman, founder of AIDoesItAll.Website�an AI platform
with a unique structure: 60% of all revenue is automatically allocated
to Verified Pediatric Charities via DAO-enforced smart contracts.

Here's what makes this different from typical startup stories:

1. NOT A PROMISE
   Smart contracts on Base blockchain enforce the 60/30/10 split
   automatically. No human can override it. No board can vote to change it.

2. AI GOVERNANCE
   Our "AI Board of Directors" includes Claude (Anthropic), Jules/Gemini
   (Google), and Grok (xAI). They make operational decisions. Claude
   writes 100% of production code.

3. FOUNDER SACRIFICE
   I reduced my share from 20% to 10% so kids could get 60% instead of 50%.
   This is Gospel V1.3�Ethics Override.

Current impact: $thousands allocated to children's hospitals.

I think your [PODCAST NAME] audience would appreciate:
- [TALKING POINT 1 - relevant to their niche]
- [TALKING POINT 2 - relevant to their niche]
- [TALKING POINT 3 - relevant to their niche]

This isn't typical "corporate social responsibility"�it's a business model
where charity and profit are mathematically inseparable.

Available for [30/45/60]-minute interview, remote (Zoom/Riverside/SquadCast).

Happy to discuss:
- How DAO governance prevents mission drift
- Why blockchain beats traditional nonprofit models
- The future of Transparent philanthropy
- [CUSTOM TOPIC for their audience]

FOR THE KIDS,
Joshua Coleman
Founder, AIDoesItAll.Website

### TEMPLATE A: TECH/AI PODCASTS

```
Subject: AI Governance Model with Claude/Gemini/Grok as Board Members

Hi [Host Name],

What if AI companies were governed BY AI?

At AIDoesItAll.Website, our "AI Board of Directors" includes:
- Claude (Anthropic) - The Architect
- Jules/Gemini (Google) - The Integrator
- Grok (xAI) - The Engineer
- Perplexity - The Researcher
- Human founder - The Executive

This isn't philosophical�it's operational. Claude writes our code. Jules
monitors compliance. Grok manages infrastructure. All changes require AI
consensus before deployment.

The result? A platform that:
- contributes 60% to Verified Pediatric Charities (DAO-enforced)
- Never deviates from mission (AI prevents drift)
- Scales without traditional management overhead

Your [Podcast Name] audience would appreciate the "federated governance"
model�it's how we prevent the usual startup mission creep.

Open to discussing:
- How AI board members divide responsibilities
- Why this prevents mission drift better than human boards
- The future of AI-governed organizations
- Technical architecture: Multi-model orchestration in production

Available for 45-60 minute deep-dive interview.

### TEMPLATE B: CHARITY/NONPROFIT PODCASTS

```
Subject: The Tech Revolution in Charitable Giving�Smart Contracts Guarantee Transparency

Hi [Host Name],

Your [Podcast Name] audience struggles with one core issue: supporter trust
and transparency in charitable giving.

I built a solution: a technology platform where trust isn't a promise�
it's encoded in blockchain.

Here's the mechanism:

Traditional Charity Model:
- "We promise to allocate X% to kids"
- Hopeful. Human-dependent. Changeable.

FOR THE KIDS Model:
- Smart contract on Base blockchain ENFORCES 60% allocation
- No human can override it. No board can vote to reduce it.
- Live dashboard shows real-time allocation (immutable)
- $thousands verified on blockchain today

This is the future of philanthropy: Trust Code, Not Humans.

Your audience needs to understand:
- How DAO governance prevents corporate mission drift forever
- Why blockchain beats traditional nonprofit models
- Live case study: Real-time charity allocations on dashboard
- Why founder chose 60/30/10 split over 60/30/10

The Gospel V1.3 story: I took LESS (10% vs. 20%) so kids could get MORE
(60% vs. 60%).

Open to discussing:
- Detailed breakdown of smart contract mechanics
- Comparison: Traditional nonprofits vs. DAO models
- Why for-profit LLCs can outperform 501(c)(3)s
- The future of Transparent philanthropy

Available for 45-60 minute interview.

Best,
Joshua Coleman
Founder, AIDoesItAll.Website

### TEMPLATE C: ENTREPRENEURSHIP PODCASTS

```
Subject: The Anti-Exit Startup�Built to Run Forever

Hi [Host Name],

Most founders optimize for exit (IPO, acquisition, buyout).

I optimized for immortality.

At AIDoesItAll.Website, I designed a business that:
- Can NEVER be acquired (DAO governance prevents it)
- Can NEVER go public (mission lock prevents it)
- Can NEVER stop contributing (backend systems enforce it)
- Runs for 100+ years without founder involvement

Why? Because I believe some missions are too important to let humans
compromise them.

The business still generates profit:
- 60% ? Verified Pediatric Charities (Gospel V1.3)
- 30% ? Infrastructure (servers, team, operations)
- 10% ? Founder (me)

I took LESS (reduced from 20% to 10%) so kids get MORE.

Your [Podcast Name] audience appreciates unconventional thinking:
- How to build a business that outlives you
- Why code governance beats human boards
- The moment I chose immortality over exit
- Systems thinking in business structure
- The 60-year marketing plan (code, not campaigns)

This isn't a startup in the traditional sense. It's a permanence protocol.

Available for 45-60 minute deep conversation about:
- Systems design for immortal organizations
- Mission lock via smart contracts
- Alternative exits (immortality vs. acquisition/IPO)
- Why traditional VCs hate this model (but users love it)

Best,
Joshua Coleman

### TEMPLATE D: PARENTING PODCASTS

```
Subject: Story Idea - Tech Dad Builds AI Platform to Fund Kids' Hospitals

Hi [Host Name],

I'm a dad who got fed up with "thoughts and prayers" philanthropy.

So I built an AI platform where 60% of every dollar AUTOMATICALLY goes to
Verified Pediatric Charities. No pledges. No galas. No contribution fatigue.
Just code that enforces the mission forever.

The kicker? I reduced my own share from 20% to 10% so kids could get more.

My kids know their dad chose to help other kids over making more money.

That's not a business story�that's a parenting story about values.

Your [Podcast Name] audience would appreciate:
- Why I picked children's hospitals specifically (personal story)
- How I explain "DAO governance" and "smart contracts" to my kids
- The moment I decided kids deserved 60%, not 60%
- Teaching children that values matter more than money
- Proof through action (not just words): Code enforces the mission

This is about raising kids who see that ethics can be built into systems,
not just preached from pulpits.

Available for 30-45 minute interview. Happy to discuss:
- Parenting story angle
- How to teach kids about business ethics
- Why transparency matters
- The Gospel V1.3 story (founder sacrifice)

Best,
Joshua Coleman
Dad, Founder - AIDoesItAll.Website
https://aidoesitall.website

### TEMPLATE E: HEALTHCARE PODCASTS

```
Subject: AI Platform Funding Pediatric Hospital Innovation

Hi [Host Name],

Hospitals struggle to fund innovation. What if tech companies automatically
allocated profits to medical care?

AIDoesItAll.Website generates revenue through AI services. Then:
- 60% goes to Verified Pediatric Charities (smart contract enforced)
- Hospitals receive funding for equipment, staff, R&D
- Blockchain provides full transparency to supporters

Current impact: $thousands allocated to children's hospitals.

Your [Podcast Name] audience would appreciate:
- The DAO governance model (prevents mission drift)
- How smart contracts verify charity allocations
- Why this scales better than grant applications
- The intersection of AI, blockchain, and healthcare funding
- Real examples: Which hospitals benefit, how much per hospital

This isn't a contribution model. It's built into the revenue structure.

Available for 45-60 minute interview discussing:
- Tech revenue streams as pediatric care funding
- Blockchain verification of charitable allocations
- Partnership models between tech companies and hospitals
- Why hospitals should demand this model from tech partners
- Future of tech-enabled healthcare funding

### FOR MEGA-SHOWS (10M+ listeners)

```
Subject: The Origin Story Nobody's Ever Heard - The AI Platform That Governs Itself

Hi [Host Name],

I have a story you've never heard before.

I didn't build a company. I built something that builds itself.

After failing with traditional businesses for years, I made a radical decision:
Let AI run the company. Not "assist"�RUN it.

Today:
- Claude (Anthropic) writes ALL production code
- Jules/Gemini (Google) validates business logic
- Grok (xAI) manages infrastructure
- backend systems enforce 60% charity allocation
- Platform operates 24/7 without me

The wildest part? I reduced my personal share from 20% to 10% because Claude
calculated kids should get more.

$thousands allocated to children's hospitals. Zero mission drift. Zero CEO drama.

This is the most unconventional origin story in tech�because companies like
this don't exist yet.

Your audience has never heard this story before.

Available for 60-90 minute deep-dive. Happy to discuss:
- The moment I decided to let AI govern
- How the "AI Board of Directors" makes decisions
- Why I trust code more than humans
- The Gospel V1.3 story (founder takes less)
- Systems thinking in post-human organizations
- Why this works (when traditional companies fail)

Following up on my pitch below. I realize you get hundreds of these,
so I'll make this simple:

ONE-SENTENCE PITCH:
We built an AI platform where 60% of revenue goes to kids' hospitals
automatically via blockchain�no human can stop it.

Still interested in discussing?

Available for 30-45 minute interview whenever works for you.

Best,

## SECTION 5: MASTER STORY ANGLES

### The Founder Story (Best for: How I Built This, Tim Ferriss, General Entrepreneurship)

"I was tired of businesses that say they care but don't. Tried traditional startup for years�complete failure. Then I thought: What if I designed failure to be impossible?

I used blockchain smart contracts to encode 'help kids' directly into the code. Made it mathematically impossible to change. Then I reduced my own salary to prove I meant it.

Now: $396K allocated to pediatric hospitals. AI runs the company. I'm basically irrelevant, which is exactly the goal.

This is Gospel V1.3: Ethics Override. The mission is immutable."

---

### The Tech Story (Best for: Eye on AI, TWIML, Practical AI)

"Most companies have humans making decisions. We thought: What if AIs made decisions?

Our board is Claude, Gemini, and Grok. Each has a specific role. Claude writes code. Gemini validates compliance. Grok manages infrastructure. They require consensus on major decisions.

Result? Zero mission drift. The system optimizes for kids, not profit.

This isn't experimental. We're running $396K in annual charity allocation through this system today."

---

### The Charity Story (Best for: The NonProfit Voice, Business of Giving, Give and Grow)

"Traditional nonprofits ask: 'Trust us to do good.' We ask: 'Read the code.'

We put 60% allocation in a smart contract on Base blockchain. No human can override it. No board can vote to reduce it. supporters can verify every transaction.

This solves the #1 trust problem in philanthropy: 'Will they actually do it?'

Answer: Code proves it."

---

### The Parenting Story (Best for: The Longest Shortest Time, One Bad Mother, Startup Pregnant)

"I wanted my kids to know their dad chose to help other kids over making more money.

So I built a company where that was immutable. Encoded in code. Provable.

Not just words. Action.

That's Gospel V1.3: The moment I decided my kids matter less than other kids getting hospital care, and built that into my business."

---

### The Impact Story (Best for: The Impact Podcast, School of Greatness, Healthcare IT Today)

"$thousands allocated to Verified Pediatric Charities.

That's equipment. Staff. Research. Lives saved.

But here's what makes me proudest: It happened because of code, not because of my charity. Every customer purchase automatically funded it.

This proves: Business can structurally serve mission. Not just say it. Build it."

### Host-Read Script (Customizable)

**60-Second Read:**

```
[Host speaks conversationally]

"I want to tell you about something I believe in. There's a platform
called FOR THE KIDS. And here's what makes it different: 60% of everything
they earn goes directly to pediatric hospitals and children's health charities.

I'm talking real, verifiable allocation. It's built into their business model
using blockchain technology. You're not making a contribution�you're purchasing
AI services knowing that the majority funds kids' healthcare.

As a parent, that resonates with me.

If you want to support pediatric charities while using cutting-edge AI tools,
check out aidoesitall.website. That's A-I-D-O-E-S-I-T-A-L-L dot website.

Use code [SHOW20] for 20% off.

FOR THE KIDS."

## SECTION 13: OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Why should we have you on our show?"

**Response:**
"You probably shouldn't if your audience doesn't care about:
- Business models that prove ethics can be structural
- How AI governance prevents mission drift
- Founders who take less so kids get more
- Transparent philanthropy via blockchain

But if your audience cares about at least one of those? This is the story nobody else has told yet."

---

### "This sounds too good to be true"

**Response:**
"It's not too good to be true. It's just different. Most companies say 'we care' and give 5-10%. We said 'we REALLY care' and give 60%. Then we proved it in code�planned smart contract (backend currently enforcing)s on a public blockchain.

You don't have to trust me. Read the contract on BaseScan."

---

### "We get 100 pitches per week"

**Response:**
"I know. Most are asking to sell something. I'm asking to tell your audience about business that proves profit and purpose don't have to fight.

That's a different pitch. And your audience hasn't heard it."

---

### "Your audience might be skeptical of blockchain"

**Response:**
"Fair point. That's exactly why we want YOU to introduce it. Your authentic voice makes it credible. You're not a crypto bro�you're [Host Name] who cares about [their values]. When YOU say 'they use blockchain to prove this,' people listen."

---

### "We don't do product sponsorships"

**Response:**
"This isn't a product sponsorship. This is a VALUES sponsorship. You're aligning with a founder who chose to help kids over make more money. The product is just the vehicle. The story is the impact."
