## SECTION 14: FINAL NOTES & GOSPEL COMPLIANCE

### 14.1 Brand Voice Guidelines

**Tone:**
- Professional but approachable (not corporate jargon)
- Technical but accessible (explain jargon)
- Confident but humble (data-driven, not boastful)
- Mission-driven (always tie back to helping kids)

**Examples:**
- ? "Our planned smart contract (backend enforcement active) smart contract ensures 60% goes to verified pediatric charities"
- ? "We allocate some money to kids"
- ? "goal: help thousands of children (and counting)"
- ? "We've made a difference"

### 14.2 Gospel V1.3 Immutable Requirements

**All content MUST adhere to:**
- ? 60/30/10 split (NEVER 60/30/10 or any other ratio)
- ? "Profit allocation" language (NEVER "treasury" or "contribution")
- ? "Verified Pediatric Charities" (NEVER generic "charities")
- ? Brand colors: Coral, Blue, Teal, Gold, Green (NEVER default colors)
- ? "FOR THE KIDS" tagline (ALWAYS, everywhere)
- ? "This split is immutable and hardcoded in our smart contract" (when discussing split)
- ? Impact metrics: goal: help thousands of children
- ? Smart contract transparency links (BaseScan)

### 14.3 Content Calendar Integration

All posts follow this structure:
1. **Introduction** (Set context, include primary keyword)
2. **Main sections** (H2 headers, include secondary keywords)
3. **Gospel compliance statement** (Verify 60/30/10)
4. **Call-to-action** (Drive conversions or engagement)
5. **Conclusion** (Reinforce mission)
