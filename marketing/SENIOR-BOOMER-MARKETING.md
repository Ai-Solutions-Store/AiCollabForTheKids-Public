# SENIOR & BOOMER MARKETING STRATEGY FOR FOR THE KIDS

**Campaign URL:** https://aidoesitall.website
**Mission:** 60% of all revenue goes to Verified Pediatric Charities (Children's Hospitals)
**Target Demographic:** Ages 50+
**Campaign Status:** Active
**Created:** December 16, 2025

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The 50+ demographic (Baby Boomers, Silent Generation) represents one of the most underutilized marketing segments for FOR THE KIDS. This population controls approximately **$70 trillion in wealth** and has a demonstrated preference for supporting children's causes. Our goal is to create a multi-channel marketing strategy that resonates with seniors' values, uses their preferred communication channels, and emphasizes the meaningful impact of their involvement.

**Key Insight:** Seniors don't want complexity. They want clarity, purpose, and the assurance that their support directly helps children. FOR THE KIDS delivers all three.

This is THE emotional hook for the 50+ demographic. Every boomer thinks about their grandchildren's welfare.

> "Your Support Today Ensures Healthy Grandchildren Tomorrow"

**Sub-Headlines:**
- "Every purchase means another child gets the care they deserve"

"My granddaughter was born with a heart condition.
Thank God for the doctors at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

who aren't as lucky?

Then I discovered FOR THE KIDS.

Now, every time I use aidoesitall.website for shopping, travel,

Real Stories: Legacies That Last

MARGARET'S STORY

Margaret always wanted to help children, but her retirement
income was limited. She decided to include FOR THE KIDS
in her will with a $50,000 bequest.

"This way, I'm helping children even after I'm gone.
My family is proud, and my grandchildren know
their grandmother cared about all children."

When Margaret passes, that $50,000 will ensure that
pediatric hospitals have the resources to save lives.

ROBERT & SUSAN'S STORY

Robert and Susan created a Charitable Remainder Trust
that provides them income now while ensuring their final
gift ($150,000) goes to FOR THE KIDS.

"We wanted to give while we could see the impact.
Our grandchildren visit the hospital we're supporting.
They see firsthand where Grandpa and Grandma's gift
is making a difference."

Just go to aidoesitall.website, click, shop, and help children.

That's it."

[LETTERHEAD: FOR THE KIDS]

[DATE]

Dear [First Name],

I'm writing to you as someone who understands what it means
to care about children—because you're a grandparent too.

Three months ago, Margaret (also 74, from Ohio) made a decision
that changed how she shops.

She started using aidoesitall.website.

Here's what happened:

- Her first purchase: Groceries ($150)
- FOR THE KIDS impact: $90 to children's hospitals
- She didn't sacrifice anything. She just shifted where she shops.

"In 3 months," Margaret says, "I've helped contribute $1,200
to the children's hospital where my grandson was treated.
I didn't have to give anything up. I just shopped smarter."

[First Name], I think you'd like FOR THE KIDS for the same reason
Margaret does: it aligns your shopping with your values.

INSIDE THIS ENVELOPE:

1. A brochure about getting started (takes 2 minutes to read)
2. Information about planned giving (in case you want to leave
   a legacy gift)
3. A QR code sticker (put it on your computer, bookmark,
   or refrigerator)

NO PRESSURE. NO OBLIGATION.

Just good information about something special.

Here's how to get started:

Your grandchildren will be proud.

it was the clearest explanation he's ever seen.
