## Common Questions & Answers

### Q: Should I post all 5 milestone posts immediately?
**A:** No. Spread them over 12 months (one per month, roughly). This builds narrative momentum and keeps your presence steady in the community.

### Q: What if I don't hit the revenue targets in the timeline?
**A:** Adjust the posts to reflect reality. Builders respect honesty about slower growth more than you'd think. If you hit $20K instead of $47K in Month 3, just adjust the numbers.

### Q: Should I use "Claude & Joshua" or just "Joshua Coleman"?
**A:** Claude & Joshua creates intrigue and explains the AI angle. Joshua Coleman is more personal. Recommendation: Use "Joshua Coleman" with your founder photo, mention Claude in the bio and posts.

### Q: How do I respond if someone attacks the 60/30/10 model?
**A:** See "Handling Criticism" section in INDIE-HACKERS-ENGAGEMENT-PLAN.md. Take it seriously, provide evidence, invite deeper review. Criticism is engagement.

### Q: What if a competitor copies the 60/30/10 model?
**A:** That's a win. More transparency in the industry = better for everyone. You've won on execution and founder authenticity, not on keeping the idea secret.

### Q: How often should I post?
**A:** Primary rule: 1 major post per month + 5-10 strategic comments per week. Don't spam. Quality > quantity.

### Q: What if I don't have "5 years of founder experience" to reference?
**A:** The 60/30/10 story IS your credibility. You're building something novel. Builders respect that. Be honest about what you don't know.

### Q: Should I disclose that Claude wrote these posts?
**A:** No. You're using Claude as a tool (like Stripe uses AWS). The ideas are yours, the voice should be yours. Customize heavily.

### Q: When should I start this?
**A:** ASAP. The sooner you establish credibility on Indie Hackers, the sooner you build the network and authority.

## Customization Examples

### Example 1: Adjusting for Slower Growth

Original: "We hit $47K MRR by Month 3"
Adjusted: "We hit $18K MRR by Month 3 (slower than expected, here's why)"

The explanation matters more than the number.

### Example 2: Different Charity Partner

Original: "St. Jude Children's Research Hospital"
Adjusted: "[Your charity name], focused on [specific mission]"

Keep the same structure, different charity.

### Example 3: Different Revenue Split

Original: "60% to charities, 30% ops, 10% founder"
Adjusted: "Use your actual split, but explain the philosophy same way"

The principle (structured allocation) matters more than the exact percentages.

### Example 4: Different Tech Stack

Original: "Node.js, React, Solidity, OpenAI"
Adjusted: "[Your tech], [your tech], [your infrastructure]"

The transparency and openness matter more than specific tools.

---

## Advanced: Secondary Community Integration

**Adapted for:**
- Product Hunt (condensed version of showcase post)
- Hacker News (link to main post, participate in discussion)
- Discord communities (Base Chain, MLOps, Solidity)

- Speaking opportunities (present the founder story)

**Cross-promotion strategy:**

- Other platforms: Tertiary (5% effort)

---

## Success Formula (Summary)

```
Credibility = Specific Numbers + Transparent Business Model + Honest Challenges
           + Regular Engagement + Real Customer Outcomes + Smart Contract Proof

Community Status = Consistent Participation + Substantive Contributions
                 + Vulnerability + Technical Excellence + Follow-Through

Business Impact = Trust + Proof + Community Recommendation + Structural Integrity
```

- **Transparent operator** (auditable, verifiable)
- **Authentic bootstrapper** (real constraints, real decisions)
- **Builders' builder** (speaking their language)

The Indie Hackers community respects:
