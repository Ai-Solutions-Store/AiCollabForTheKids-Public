## PART 2: PRODUCT POST TEMPLATE

### Main Launch Post Structure

```markdown
**Headline (Hook):** Problem statement + solution promise

**PRODUCT POST TEMPLATE FOR INDIE HACKERS:**

---

## [Product Name]: AI Platform with Mandatory 60% Profit Allocation

**The Problem We're Solving:**
[2-3 sentences about the pain point in AI/tech infrastructure]

**Our Solution:**
[What makes us different technically]

**The Ethical Angle:**
This isn't marketing. We're structured so that 60% of all revenue
allocation goes directly to verified pediatric charities. Not after
expenses. Not  contributions. Actual profit split.

**How It Works:**
1. User purchases/subscribes
2. Revenue flows through our smart contract (Base mainnet)
3. 60% ? Verified charity wallets (automated, transparent)
4. 30% ? Infrastructure & ops
5. 10% ? Founder allocation

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Node.js + OpenAI APIs
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Chain: Base (Ethereum Layer 2)
- Governance: DAO structure with token allocation

**Current Status:**
[Development stage, beta users, etc.]

**Launch URL:** https://aidoesitall.website
**Smart Contract (auditable on Basescan):** Planned (Q1 2026)

**What We're Looking For:**
- Technical feedback on the profit allocation model
- Beta users comfortable with transparency
- Partners interested in ethical AI infrastructure
- Developers wanting to fork/build on our contracts

**Why Indie Hackers?**
You get the full picture: the tech AND the financial model. No hidden
agendas. This is what transparent startup building looks like.

---
```

### Key Messaging Rules for Product Post

**DO:**
- Lead with the technology (not the charity angle)
- Frame 60% allocation as "profit allocation" not "contribution"
- Show contract address (transparency builds trust with hackers)
- Be specific about revenue splits
- Explain WHY you chose this model (founder wanted less, kids get more)

**DON'T:**
- Sound preachy or sanctimonious
- Position as "non-profit" (you're not - it's a for-profit tech company)
- Hide the business model
- Use emotional charity language ("helping children")
- Oversell the ethical angle (builders respect integrity, not marketing)

---

## PART 3: FIVE MILESTONE POSTS

### Milestone Post 1: Launch Week (Day 1-3)
**Title:** "We're Building AI Infrastructure Where 60% Revenue Goes to Kids' Charities"

```markdown
**Today we're launching FOR THE KIDS on Indie Hackers.**

This is our Year 1 milestone: shipping the core AI platform with
transparent profit allocation built into the smart contract.

**What actually shipped:**
- OpenAI-powered API endpoints with multi-model support
- Base mainnet integration (contract address visible on Basescan)
- Automated revenue split (60% to verified charity wallets)
- DAO governance framework (token holders vote on charity selections)
- Rate-limiting + authentication for production use

**What we learned building this:**
1. Profit allocation is infrastructure, not marketing
   - Had to build separate wallet contracts for automatic splitting
   - Revenue updates trigger charity transfers (no manual intervention)

2. Builders care about transparency more than feel-good stories
   - Contract address gets more Basescan views than our blog
   - Questions about code are more interesting than mission statements

3. Hiring around ethics is actually possible
   - Team members who WANT to work on this exist
   - They chose lower pay for aligned impact

**Open questions we're thinking about:**
- How do you make DAO governance accessible to non-technical backers?
- What happens when charity priorities shift but contracts are immutable?
- Should we open-source the profit allocation contracts?

**Want to help?**
- Technical reviewers of the smart contract
- Beta testers who understand Base chain transactions
- Charity partners interested in transparent automation

**Live now:** https://aidoesitall.website
**Contract:** Planned (Q1 2026)

Feedback welcome. This is the real story of what we built.
```

### Milestone Post 2: First Paid User (Week 2-3)
**Title:** "We Just Hit Our First Revenue Allocation - Here's What Happened"

```markdown
**Update: Our first user paid. Then $[amount] went to St. Jude.**

This is the moment where theory meets practice.

**The mechanic:**
1. Customer subscribes to our API tier ($[X]/month)
2. Payment hits our Stripe account
3. Monthly, automation triggers our smart contract
4. 60% of that month's revenue ? Verified beneficiary allocation on Base
5. Transaction visible on Basescan (wallet address: [ADDRESS])
6. St. Jude's finance team gets a report showing the automated transfer

**What was harder than expected:**
- Getting charity finance teams to accept automated wallet transfers
  (Not a technical problem; a coordination problem)
- Explaining that "profit allocation" isn't a pledge or promise
  (It's a legal structure - boring but important)

**What validated our approach:**
- Our first customer specifically chose us because of the model
- They said: "I'd rather pay slightly more knowing where 60% goes"
- That's the economic proof that this works

**What's next:**
- Scale to [X] users by Q1
- Add [Y] additional charities to profit allocation
- Open-source the revenue-split contract template

**Live:** https://aidoesitall.website
**Transparency dashboard:** [URL - shows all allocations YTD]

Builders: Does this change how you think about startup business models?
```

---

### Milestone Post 3: Infrastructure Scaling (Month 2-3)
**Title:** "How We're Making AI Infrastructure Sustainable (Profit Allocation Edition)"

```markdown
**Behind the scenes: How we scaled to [X] API requests/month
while maintaining the 60% allocation model.**

**The problem we solved:**
Most AI platforms have margin erosion at scale:
- More users = more compute costs = lower margins = less to "give back"
- We needed to prove that transparency + scale don't conflict

**Our solution:**
1. DAO-governed cloud provider selection (community votes on where infra $$$ goes)
2. Multi-region Base integration (lower gas costs for frequent allocations)
3. Batch revenue processing (weekly instead of real-time = smarter contract calls)

**The numbers:**
- Infrastructure costs: [X]% of revenue (was [Y]% at launch)
- Founder allocation: [Z]% of revenue (staying consistent)
- Charity allocation: 60% (untouched - this is the commitment)

**Why this matters:**
- Profit allocation isn't a feature that disappears at scale
- The DAO model lets builders and users decide infrastructure spending
- Margins improve, allocation stays the same

**What we learned:**
- Cloud providers actually respect transparent business models
  (Negotiated better rates once we explained the structure)
- Builders want to see the unit economics of "doing good"
- Charity partners appreciate predictable, growing revenue

**Metrics this month:**
- [X] monthly active users
- [Y] API requests processed
- [Z]% uptime
- [AMOUNT] total allocated to charities YTD

**Contract address:** Planned (Q1 2026)
**View all allocations on Basescan:** [LINK]

What would make this more trustworthy for potential customers?
```

---

### Milestone Post 4: DAO Governance Activation (Month 3-4)
**Title:** "We Just Handed Over Charity Selection to Our Users (Via DAO)"

```markdown
**Announcement: Token holders can now vote on which charities
receive FOR THE KIDS allocations.**

This is what "transparent governance" actually means.

**How it works:**
1. We verified 15 pediatric charities (backgrounds, financials, impact reports)
2. Token holders vote on which charities get allocated the 60%
3. Once per quarter, votes execute (smart contract sends allocations automatically)
4. All votes are visible on-chain (Basescan shows voting record)

**Why we did this:**
- Saying "we support kids' charities" is easy
- Actually letting users PICK which ones? That's accountability
- This forces us to stay legitimate (no backroom decisions)

**Token allocation:**
- Contributors: [X] tokens (builders get voting power)
- Users: [Y] tokens (customer voting power)
- DAO treasury: [Z] tokens (reserved for future governance)
- Founder: [W] tokens (0 voting power on allocations - by design)

**Voting metrics:**
- [X]% voter participation in round 1
- [Y] charities nominated
- [Z] charities selected

**The charities chosen this quarter:**
1. [Charity A] - Gets [X]% of allocation
2. [Charity B] - Gets [Y]% of allocation
3. [Charity C] - Gets [Z]% of allocation

**Live voting:** [LINK to DAO interface]
**Voting history (on-chain):** [Basescan link]

**What this proves:**
- We're not a "charity brand" - we're actually distributed governance
- Users have structural influence (not just feedback)
- The allocation model survives user scrutiny

For builders: How would you improve this?
```

---

### Milestone Post 5: One Year Impact Report (Month 12)
**Title:** "FOR THE KIDS Year 1: $[X] Allocated to Charities, Here's the Full Breakdown"

```markdown
**One year in. We allocated $[X] to pediatric charities.
Here's exactly where it went.**

**The numbers:**
- Total revenue: $[X]
- Charity allocation (60%): $[Y]
- Infrastructure spend (30%): $[Z]
- Founder allocation (10%): $[W]

**Where the 60% went:**
- St. Jude Children's Research Hospital: $[A] (allocated via Q1 vote)
- Children's Hospital Los Angeles: $[B] (Q2 vote)
- Boston Children's Hospital: $[C] (Q3/Q4 vote)
- [Other charities]: $[D]

**Charity impact (according to their reports):**
- St. Jude: Used FOR THE KIDS allocation to [specific research/services]
- CHLA: Used FOR THE KIDS allocation to [specific research/services]
- BCH: Used FOR THE KIDS allocation to [specific research/services]

**User metrics:**
- [X] monthly active users
- [Y] API calls processed
- [Z]% uptime
- [W] hours of compute contributed to research

**Team metrics:**
- [X] employees
- [Y] contractors/contributors
- [Z] DAO governance voters

**What we're doing differently in Year 2:**
1. Expanding to [X] additional charities
2. Adding monthly governance votes (faster allocation cycles)
3. Open-sourcing the profit-split contract template
4. Building a web3 contribution matching fund (users can contribute directly, 3x match from our allocation)

**Technical improvements:**
- L1 integrations (Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism)
- Reduced smart contract gas costs by [X]%
- Multi-signature recovery on charity wallets (enhanced security)

**The honest assessment:**
- What we got right: The allocation model actually works at scale
- What we underestimated: How much governance overhead is needed
- What surprised us: Charities care about predictability more than total amount

**View full audit:** [LINK to transparent financial records]
**Live dashboard:** https://aidoesitall.website

**To builders reading this:**
You can run a sustainable tech company AND do transparent good.
You don't have to choose. You just have to architect it from day one.

This is what Year 2 looks like. Thoughts?

## PART 4: TEN DISCUSSION STARTER COMMENTS

These are comments to post on existing Indie Hackers discussions (not our own posts)
to drive traffic and establish credibility.

### Comment 1: On "How to Fund Your Startup"
**Context:** Discussion about funding models, investor dynamics

```markdown
We took a different approach: we eliminated the cap table conflict.

60% of our revenue goes directly to verified charities (automated via smart
contract on Base). No founder later says "we should keep more." No investor
asks "why are we giving this away?" The structure makes the decision for us.

Year 1 result: simpler operations, clearer decision-making, customers who
specifically chose us because of it.

The trap most founders hit: doing good as a *feature* instead of
*infrastructure*. If it's a feature, it dies when margin pressure hits.
If it's architecture, it survives because the money goes out automatically.

Curious if anyone else has tried embedding a business decision this deep
into the company structure.

**FOR THE KIDS** - https://aidoesitall.website
```

### Comment 2: On "Business Model Questions"
**Context:** Discussion about recurring revenue, pricing, profitability

```markdown
Unpopular opinion: if your business model isn't transparent enough to
put on a blockchain, it probably isn't as clean as you think.

We publish all our allocations on-chain (Planned (Q1 2026)).
Every dollar in, we can show exactly where 60 cents goes.

This forced us to:
1. Actually define "profit" (accounting gets real fast)
2. Know our real unit economics (no fudging numbers)
3. Build to scale from day one (fees/overhead matter when they're transparent)

Side effect: investors actually respect it more because the numbers can't lie.

The hard part isn't the ethics. It's the accounting discipline required to back
up the ethics. But that's... kind of a good hard part to have.

Anyone else using blockchain for financial transparency (not as a product,
but as internal infrastructure)?
```

### Comment 3: On "Building in Public"
**Context:** Discussion about transparency, sharing progress

```markdown
Building in public + transparent business model = trust acceleration.

We share revenue allocations alongside product updates. Some people think
that's oversharing (it's not - it's the business model).

What we found: people are way more likely to use your product when they
know exactly where their money goes. It's not about being "nice" - it's about
reducing uncertainty.

Revenue allocation as marketing is cheap. Revenue allocation as
*architecture* is how you win.

Curious: does anyone else use their business model as a founding competitive advantage?
```

### Comment 4: On "DAO Governance"
**Context:** Discussion about decentralized decision-making, token models

```markdown
Most DAOs fail because they try to decentralize *everything*.

We used DAOs for one specific decision: which charities receive our 60% allocation.
That's it. One decision, democratized, on-chain, immutable.

Why this works:
- It's a decision with a clear scope (not fuzzy)
- The outcome is auditable (money goes where votes said)
- Bad actors have no advantage (you can't profit from voting)

The rest of the company runs normally (founder makes operational decisions,
engineering team ship features).

This combo of "centralized operations + decentralized allocation" seems way
more sustainable than full DAO governance.

Any governance people here experimenting with hybrid models?
```

### Comment 5: On "AI Infrastructure Costs"
**Context:** Discussion about scaling AI, compute expenses

```markdown
AI is so expensive right now that margin collapse is real.
We had to make a weird choice: either cut our allocation % or build smarter infrastructure.

We built smarter. Used DAO governance to let users vote on our cloud provider
(they picked the one with best carbon footprint, not just cheapest). This is
infrastructure + values alignment baked in.

Result: margins actually improved while allocation stayed constant.

The point: don't let "doing good" be separate from "building efficiently."
They should inform each other from the beginning.

Props to any founders using constraint (like a fixed allocation %) as innovation pressure.
```

### Comment 6: On "Transparency vs. Privacy"
**Context:** Discussion about sharing business metrics, privacy concerns

```markdown
We put our entire financial model on Ethereum mainnet (via Base) where anyone
can audit it.

People ask: "Isn't that privacy risk?"

Honestly? No. Our privacy risk isn't financial transparency - it's data
security. Those are different problems. You can have both.

Financial transparency actually helps us:
- Customers trust we're not lying about allocations
- Charity partners trust money arrives as promised
- Employees see the numbers match the mission

The tricky part: being transparent about money without being reckless about
other data (customer PII, contract details, etc.).

Any builders in here wrestling with this? What's your balance?
```

### Comment 7: On "Founder Salary and Ethics"
**Context:** Discussion about founder compensation, taking less pay for values

```markdown
This is probably controversial, but: founder pay should be visible.

We publish ours (it's 10% of revenue - about half market rate for our role).
Not to virtue signal. Because it changes behavior in a useful way:

1. Every expense matters more (you feel the tradeoff viscerally)
2. You can't hide bad decisions in overhead
3. Investors respect founders who've thought about their own incentives

The weird outcome: we get better team members than when I was trying to maximize
personal comp. People want to work somewhere the numbers make sense.

Might be industry-specific, but curious if anyone else has experimented with
radically transparent founder compensation?
```

### Comment 8: On "Measuring Impact"
**Context:** Discussion about metrics, KPIs, measuring what matters

```markdown
The hardest metric to measure: did we actually do good?

We track the obvious stuff ($ to charities), but that's easy. The hard question:
did those dollars move the needle on real outcomes?

Our approach: ask the charities directly. Not in a compliance way - actually
talk to the researchers about whether our allocation moved their work forward.

This led to a shift: instead of giving 60% to whoever, we now vote on charities
where *our specific users* can have measurable impact. An API for one charity
vs. another has different ROI.

It's weird to apply "ROI" to charity. But if you're committed to allocation,
you owe it to yourself to make those dollars count.

How do other builders measure impact beyond just "did we do the thing?"
```

### Comment 9: On "Startup Fatigue and Purpose"
**Context:** Discussion about burnout, keeping motivation, founder mental health

```markdown
Real talk: the reason I haven't burned out in Year 1 is because the business
model aligns with my actual values.

When revenue goes up, something I care about gets more funding. I don't have
to rationalize it. I don't have to feel guilty about profit. I don't have to
argue with investors about "social responsibility."

The structure decided it. Now I just optimize for operational excellence.

This is probably only available to founders who can afford to take 10% instead
of 30%. So I'm aware of the privilege here. But if you *can* structure your
company this way, I think it's worth considering, just for the mental health ROI.

Anyone else find that purpose-aligned business model actually improves execution?
```

### Comment 10: On "Building with AI Ethics"
**Context:** Discussion about AI safety, responsibility, vendor selection

```markdown
Most "ethical AI" conversations are abstract. We made it concrete: our profit
allocation funds research at children's hospitals studying AI's effects.

So when we make infrastructure decisions, we know where the margin goes. We can
actually ask: "does this decision help or hurt the research we fund?"

Examples:
- Chose cloud provider with best AI safety practices (even if slightly more expensive)
- Open-sourced our allocation contracts (competitors can copy the model)
- Contributed compute time to pediatric research initiatives

The ROI: it makes decision-making *faster*, not slower. You have fewer options
when you filter for "does this align" + "is it quality" + "can we afford it?"

Constraints are features.

How are other builders incorporating their values into infrastructure decisions?
```

## PART 6: BEST POSTING TIMES

### Indie Hackers Optimal Posting Schedule

```markdown
BEST TIMES TO POST (All times in UTC)

Primary Launch Post:
- Day: Tuesday or Wednesday
- Time: 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM UTC
  (Catches 3 AM - 5 AM EST, 12 AM - 2 AM PST - early morning readers)
- Reasoning: IH founders check feed over morning coffee

Alternative Peak Time:
- Day: Thursday
- Time: 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM UTC
  (Afternoon for US East Coast, morning for US West)
- Reasoning: Mid-week engagement is strong

Engagement Comments:
- Days: Tuesday - Friday
- Times: 8 AM, 2 PM, 8 PM UTC
- Reasoning: Target multiple US time zones across a day
- Frequency: 1-2 comments per day during first week of discussion

Weekend Posting (Avoid):
- Saturday/Sunday posting performs 40% lower
- BUT commenting on weekend discussions (1-2 per day) captures
  international audience

Weekly Rhythm:
- Monday: Prepare comments for existing discussions (don't post new)
- Tuesday-Thursday: Main posts + heavy engagement
- Friday: Wind-down engagement, monitor older threads
- Saturday-Sunday: Light monitoring, respond to substantive questions
```

### Timing by Region

```markdown
REGIONAL TARGETING

If targeting US-focused:
- Post at 8 AM UTC = 3 AM EST / 12 AM PST (early birds)
- Post at 2 PM UTC = 9 AM EST / 6 AM PST (morning coffee crowd)
- Post at 6 PM UTC = 1 PM EST / 10 AM PST (lunch break crowd)

If targeting EU-focused:
- Post at 9 AM UTC = 10 AM CET (morning Europe)
- Post at 4 PM UTC = 5 PM CET (end of workday Europe)

If targeting Asia-focused:
- Post at 10 PM UTC = 6 AM JST / 9 AM Singapore (morning Asia)
- Post at 2 AM UTC = 10 AM JST (Asia daytime)

Strategy: Stagger main posts across regions weekly
- Week 1: US time zone
- Week 2: EU time zone
- Week 3: Asia time zone
- Rotate quarterly
```

### Seasonal Posting Patterns

```markdown
HIGH ENGAGEMENT PERIODS:

Q1 (January - March):
- New Year's resolutions for entrepreneurship
- Indie hackers setting annual goals
- Post frequency: 2x per month

Q2 (April - June):
- Conference season, networking peaks
- Summer project planning
- Post frequency: 1-2x per month

Q3 (July - September):
- Slower (summer break)
- IH community less active
- Post frequency: 1x per month (light engagement)

Q4 (October - December):
- Year-end reviews, reflection mode
- Holiday project launches
- Impact measurement discussions peak
- Post frequency: 2-3x per month

Holiday-Specific Avoidance:
- Thanksgiving week: Avoid main posts (low engagement)
- Christmas week: Avoid main posts (low engagement)
- New Year week: POST AGGRESSIVELY (resolution mindset)
```

## PART 7: ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

### Response Protocol

```markdown
ENGAGEMENT TIER 1: CRITICAL RESPONSES (under 2 hours)
- Technical questions about smart contract
- Questions about the 60/30/10 split
- Criticism of business model
- Partnership inquiries

ENGAGEMENT TIER 2: IMPORTANT RESPONSES (under 6 hours)
- Questions about API capabilities
- User onboarding questions
- General product feedback
- Pricing questions

ENGAGEMENT TIER 3: NORMAL RESPONSES (under 24 hours)
- Comments asking for clarification
- Related but tangential discussions
- Community building conversations
- Off-topic but friendly discussion

ENGAGEMENT TIER 4: LOW PRIORITY (monitored, respond if adds value)
- Duplicate questions (link to previous answer)
- Spam/promotion (ignore or flag)
- Personal opinions unrelated to product
```

### Comment Strategy by Thread Type

```markdown
DISCUSSION TYPE: "Should I care about ethics in business?"

Your Response Strategy:
1. Lead with specificity (not preachy)
2. Show the numbers (60/30/10 split)
3. Explain the mechanism (smart contract automation)
4. Invite technical review (not emotional validation)

Example:
"Ethics + business doesn't have to be in tension. The key is making it
*structural*, not aspirational.

We put the allocation in code (0x9855B75...). Can't be argued with. Can't
be compromised. It's infrastructure, not marketing.

Year 1 result: it actually *improved* operations (fewer meta-discussions
about priorities). Built-in constraints = faster decisions.

If you're building something similar, I'd be curious about your mechanism."

---

DISCUSSION TYPE: "How to grow faster?"

Your Response Strategy:
1. Acknowledge the question genuinely
2. Share non-obvious insight
3. Mention your approach (transparent model as growth lever)
4. Invite specific feedback

Example:
"Counter-intuitive: transparency can be a growth lever.

We publish everything (allocations, margin %, founder comp). Initially
scared of competition copying us. Instead, it became our best marketing.

Customers chose us specifically because they could audit our model.
Investors trusted us more (numbers can't lie).

The constraint (60% allocation) forced us to optimize unit economics harder
than we would have otherwise.

What's been your experience with transparency as competitive advantage?"

---

DISCUSSION TYPE: "AI is broken / needs ethics"

Your Response Strategy:
1. Validate the concern (don't be dismissive)
2. Offer concrete mechanism, not sentiment
3. Show how your model addresses it
4. Invite technical collaboration

Example:
"You're right that current AI incentives are broken. But the solution isn't
better intentions - it's better incentives.

We structure our profit allocation so that growth in one area (AI services)
directly funds research in pediatric AI ethics. Same margin growth = more
research funding.

The mechanism: smart contract on Base. Immutable. Auditable.

If you're thinking about this, I'd love to explore whether similar structures
could work for other AI infrastructure problems."

### Building Credibility Through Comments

**Phase 1: Observation (Days 1-7)**
- Read 20+ existing discussions
- Don't post yet
- Map the community: who are the respected voices?
- Note recurring themes

**Phase 2: Value Addition (Days 8-30)**
- Post 2-3 high-quality comments (not self-promotional)
- Share specific insights from your experience
- Link to your product only when genuinely relevant
- Build reputation as someone who knows their space

**Phase 3: Thought Leadership (Days 31-90)**
- Now you can share your own posts
- Community already knows you're substantive
- Low friction to getting upvoted/engaged
- Higher chance of meaningful follow-up

**Phase 4: Ongoing Engagement (Monthly)**
- Maintain 5-10 strategic comments per week
- Post 1 significant update per month minimum
- Respond to all replies on your posts (for 72 hours)
- Contribute to others' discussions regularly

### Handling Criticism

```markdown
CRITICISM TYPE: "This seems like a marketing gimmick"

Response Strategy:
- Don't get defensive
- Acknowledge the concern
- Provide proof (contract address, audits, financials)
- Invite technical review

Example:
"Fair criticism. I'd be skeptical too.

The difference: we put money where our mouth is (literally on-chain).

You can verify everything:
- Smart contract: [address]
- All allocations: [Basescan link]
- Charity confirmations: [links to their tax filings]
- Revenue reports: [transparency dashboard]

If you find something that doesn't add up, I want to know. Not as a marketing
thing - as an operational thing."

---

CRITICISM TYPE: "You're just doing this to look good"

Response Strategy:
- Assume good faith
- Separate intention from mechanism
- Show the cost (founder taking 10% instead of 30%)
- Invite verification

Example:
"Maybe. Humans are complicated.

But the mechanism forces consistency: 60% goes to charities whether I want it
to or not. It's not a choice I make daily - it's architecture.

Proof: you could verify that we *tried* to reduce the allocation and couldn't
(it's in the code). We took the hit (10% founder instead of 30%) to make it work.

If my motivations are ugly but the outcome is good, does that matter?"

---

CRITICISM TYPE: "Your smart contract is vulnerable"

Response Strategy:
- TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY
- Thank them for pointing it out
- Offer bounty/credit
- Get it audited
- Report back on fix

Example:
"This is exactly what we need. Thank you.

You're right [specific vulnerability]. We have an audit firm checking now.
If you want to coordinate a formal review, I'd rather know now than at scale.

[Bounty information / audit firm details]

This is why we post the contract address - this feedback is more valuable
than a year of internal review."
```

- Baseline: [X] visits/day pre-Indie Hackers
- Goal: 2x traffic from IH by end of Month 2
- Tracking: UTM parameters on all links

METRIC: Comment quality discussion
- Baseline: [Y] low-quality comments
- Goal: 80%+ substantive technical discussion
- Tracking: Manual review of comment threads

METRIC: Inbound partnerships
- Baseline: [Z] partnership inquiries/month

## KEY MESSAGING FRAMEWORKS

### "Why profit allocation matters"

```markdown
"Most companies say they care about impact but structure their incentives
to maximize profit extraction.

We flipped it: structured to maximize *allocation* to values.

The difference: when growing the business is the same thing as growing the
charity funding, you have alignment instead of tension.

This is infrastructure. Not marketing. Not a feature. Not a promise that can
be broken.

This is how you build trust at scale."
```

### "Why this works on Base"

```markdown
"Base is how we solve the 'prove it' problem.

Everyone says they're transparent. We put the numbers on a public blockchain
where anyone can verify them forever.

Charity gets $X? That's a transaction with a receipt.
Infrastructure spent $Y? Auditable on-chain.
Founder took $Z? Visible forever.

This is what actually transparent business looks like."
```

### "Why this matters to builders"

```markdown
"If you're building AI infrastructure, you're thinking about scale.

Scale requires trust. Trust requires proof. Proof requires transparency.

We've built the mechanism. Open-source it. Improve it. Compete on execution,
not on "who cares more about good."

The business model is the strategy. The strategy is the business model.

Build accordingly."
```

## FINAL NOTES

### Brand Voice on Indie Hackers

- **Lead with technical substance** - Don't be preachy
- **Be specific** - Share actual numbers, contract addresses, audit results
- **Admit uncertainty** - "We don't know yet" is more credible than "We have all the answers"
- **Invite verification** - "Please audit this" builds more trust than "Trust us"
- **Focus on builder appeal** - Other founders respect integrity over emotion
- **Update regularly** - Stale information kills credibility

### Community Integration Philosophy

You're not promoting FOR THE KIDS to Indie Hackers.
You're **joining** Indie Hackers as someone who happens to be building FOR THE KIDS.

The difference: participation comes first, promotion comes second.

Builders can smell inauthenticity. Build something real, participate genuinely,
and the community will amplify your work.
