# ENTERPRISE PITCH TEMPLATE
## FOR THE KIDS B2B Corporate Partnership

**Target Audience:** CFOs, CSR Directors, Chief Giving Officers (Fortune 500)
**Duration:** 5-minute verbal pitch | 15-minute discovery call | 30-minute formal pitch
**Goal:** Schedule exploratory meeting

---

## 5-MINUTE ELEVATOR PITCH

### Use Case: Cold email introduction or conference networking

**Opening Hook (15 seconds):**
"Most companies have $10M+ CSR budgets, but only 2-3% of employees actually give. We've figured out how to reach 30-60% of employees using blockchain-verified giving. You basically embed 60% of business revenue into pediatric charities�it's not charity, it's your business model."

**Problem Statement (30 seconds):**
"Here's what I'm seeing with Fortune 500 CSR programs:
- Employees want to give, but matching gifts are too complicated
- CSR budgets sit partially unused because participation is low
- No real-time visibility into where money goes
- Employees feel disconnected from impact"

**Solution (45 seconds):**
"FOR THE KIDS operates a Benevolent Technocracy�60% of all revenue automatically goes to Verified Pediatric Charities via smart contract. It's blockchain-verified, zero overhead, and employees see real-time proof.

We partner with corporations to integrate this into workplace giving:
- Matching gift program (Benevity/YourCause integration)
- Volunteer day sponsorship (500-1,000 employees)
- Real-time impact dashboard
- PR + media support"

**Social Proof (30 seconds):**
"We've worked with [Company A] to reach 2,000 employees giving (vs. their previous 200 in traditional program). That's a 10x increase. They went from $100K to $1M+ annual giving in Year 1."

**Call to Action (15 seconds):**
"I'd love to grab 15 minutes next week to explore if this makes sense for your organization. No pressure�just a conversation. What does your calendar look like?"

## 15-MINUTE DISCOVERY CALL SCRIPT

### Objective: Qualify opportunity + schedule formal pitch

#### PART 1: RAPPORT & AGENDA (2 min)

**Opening:**
"Thanks again for making time, [Name]. I know CSR directors get bombarded with pitches. I promise this is different. Before I dive in, I'd love to understand your world a bit better. What's top of mind for you in CSR this year?"

**Listen for:**
- Current challenges (low participation, engagement gaps)
- Budget constraints or timelines
- Strategic priorities (ESG, kids, health, volunteering)
- Current giving platform pain points

#### PART 2: UNDERSTAND CURRENT STATE (3 min)

**Ask:**
1. "Tell me about your current matching gift program. What's the participation rate?"
2. "What's your biggest frustration with employee engagement in CSR?"
3. "Do you have volunteer day programs? How often?"
4. "What would make your CSR director's job easier?"

**Listen for:**
- Participation rates (usually 2-3%)
- Engagement challenges
- Volunteer appetite
- Tech readiness

#### PART 3: POSITION FOR THE KIDS (5 min)

**Lead with problem/solution:**
"Here's what we're hearing: Most companies have employees who want to give, but the friction is too high. If we could eliminate that friction�make giving automatic, transparent, and rewarding�what would that mean for your organization?"

**Paint the picture:**
"Imagine: You don't have to ask employees to give. Instead, you partner with a company that automatically allocates 60% of revenue to pediatric charities. Your employees choose to purchase products/services from FOR THE KIDS. 100% transparent. Zero overhead. Blockchain verified.

Then: You set up matching gifts. For every $1 employee gives, you match. No extra work for them�they just engage with FOR THE KIDS products.

Result: Instead of 200 employees giving $100K, you have 2,000 employees giving $1M+. And all of it goes to pediatric charities."

**Make it specific to them:**
- **For Microsoft:** "Your 220,000 employees = potential 6,600 givers at 3%. If we reach 5% = 11,000 givers. That's $2.75M+ to pediatric charities."
- **For Apple:** "Your brand = premium + values-aligned. Employees would love verified impact. This is narrative-perfect."
- **For J&J:** "Pediatric health IS your business. This makes it your giving model too."

#### PART 4: BRIDGE TO NEXT STEP (3 min)

**Propose pilot:**
"I'm thinking we could do a 90-day pilot program with you. Two options:

**Option A (Smaller):** Matching gift integration + monthly tracking
- Timeline: 30 days setup
- Investment: $5K-$15K
- Expected Y1 impact: $50K-$150K to pediatric charities

**Option B (Larger):** Matching gifts + 1-2 volunteer days + ERG partnerships
- Timeline: 90 days setup
- Investment: $25K-$75K
- Expected Y1 impact: $250K-$500K to pediatric charities

Which feels more aligned with where you're at?"

**Schedule follow-up:**
"Before I throw a proposal your way, I want to understand your budget cycle better. When does [Company] typically make CSR decisions? Are there internal stakeholders I should know about?"

**Close:**
"Here's what I'll do: I'll send you a 1-page overview of FOR THE KIDS + a matching gift case study from a similar company. You take a look, and let's jump on a 30-minute call next week to walk through a customized proposal. Does Thursday work better than Friday?"

## 30-MINUTE FORMAL PITCH

### Use: Presented to CSR director + CFO/VP-level sponsor

#### SLIDE 1: OPENING (2 min)
- Hero image: Children, healthcare setting, optimism
- "FOR THE KIDS: Corporate Partnership for Verified Pediatric Health"
- Tagline: "60% of revenue. Verified. Immediate impact."

#### SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM (2 min)

**CSR Budget Reality:**
- Fortune 500 companies have $30B+ annual CSR budgets
- But: Only 2-3% of employees use matching gift programs
- Problem: Employees want to give, but friction is too high
  - Complex processes (multiple platforms)
  - Long delays (6 months to see impact)
  - No real-time visibility
  - Feeling disconnected from results

**The Gap:**
- Estimated $15B+ in unused CSR giving potential

**Why This Matters for You:**
"You have $X CSR budget. But your matching gift program might only reach $Y in actual giving. We're here to close that gap."

#### SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION (3 min)

**FOR THE KIDS Business Model:**

Diagram (show flow):
```
FOR THE KIDS Revenue Stream
        ?
Smart Contract Execution
        +? 60% ? Verified Pediatric Charities
        +? 30% ? Infrastructure & Operations
        +? 10% ? Sustainable Development
        ?
100% Blockchain Transparent
        ?
Employees See Real-Time Proof
```

**Key Differentiator:**
- We're NOT asking for charity
- We're offering a product/service with embedded giving
- Employees benefit + kids benefit
- Zero overhead allocation (it's in the business model)

**How It Works:**
1. Employee purchases from FOR THE KIDS or contributes $X
2. Smart contract automatically allocates 60% to pediatric charities
3. Your company matches the gift (1:1 or 2:1)
4. Employee receives blockchain proof of impact
5. Pediatric charity receives verified allocation

#### SLIDE 4: WHY [COMPANY NAME] SHOULD CARE (3 min)

**Tailored to Company:**

**For Microsoft:**
"Your 220K employees are tech-forward. Blockchain transparency is native to their values. They trust code more than words. This is a 10x better engagement model for your workforce."

**For Apple:**
"Apple's brand is built on verified quality + integrity. This is transparency at scale. Your employees would resonate with blockchain proof more than any press release."

**For J&J:**
"Pediatric health isn't just CSR for you�it's your business. This makes employee giving an extension of what you actually do. Cultural alignment."

**For Disney:**
"Magic = making kids' dreams come true. This lets every employee be part of that magic. Narrative is perfect."

**For All Companies:**
"? Reach 5-10x more employees (vs. traditional matching gifts)
? Higher employee satisfaction + retention
? Real-time impact visibility (ESG reporting gold)
? Media coverage + PR lift
? Competitive advantage (first mover in your industry)"

#### SLIDE 5: PARTNERSHIP OPTIONS (2 min)

**Tiered Sponsor Model:**

| Option | Timeline | Investment | Expected Impact | Best For |
|--------|----------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| **BRONZE** | 30 days | $5K-$25K | $50K-$150K to charities | Testing the model |
| **SILVER** | 60 days | $25K-$75K | $250K-$500K to charities | Core program launch |
| **GOLD** | 90 days | $75K-$250K | $500K-$1.5M to charities | Flagship partnership |
| **PLATINUM** | 180 days | $250K+ | $1M-$5M+ to charities | Strategic alliance |

"We recommend starting with SILVER if you're serious about this. It's the sweet spot�enough investment to make it real, but low enough risk to pilot."

#### SLIDE 6: EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT (2 min)

**Why Employees Will Participate:**

"Employees care about impact. Traditional giving is invisible. Here's what changes:

? **Transparency:** Blockchain dashboard shows real-time allocation
? **Speed:** Impact proof in 5 minutes (not 6 months)
? **Simplicity:** One-click participation (no manual forms)
? **Alignment:** Kids health (universal resonance)
? **Community:** Giving with thousands of colleagues
? **Verification:** Immutable proof (removes doubt)

Average engagement increase: 5-10x traditional matching gifts"

**Employee Testimonial Example:**
"I gave $50 to FOR THE KIDS. Within 5 minutes, my dashboard showed $30 had reached a pediatric hospital. I could see the hospital name, the type of care. I felt it immediately. vs. Traditional giving: I contributed, got a receipt 6 months later saying 'Thanks for your support.' I never knew where it went."

#### SLIDE 7: VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITY (2 min)

**Corporate Volunteer Day Sponsorship:**

"Beyond giving, we can organize volunteer days:

**What happens:**
- 200-1,000 [Company] employees volunteer
- Activities: Hospital visits, health screenings, mentoring, fundraising
- FOR THE KIDS covers logistics (coordinator, T-shirts, impact tracking)

**What you get:**
- PR value (massive volunteer effort)
- Employee satisfaction (meaningful day)
- Brand association (kids health champion)
- Impact multiplier (giving + volunteering)

**Example:** Microsoft sponsored 500 employees. 2,000 volunteer hours. $100K+ value. Generated 8 media placements + internal PR."

## CLOSING TECHNIQUES

### If They Say "Sounds interesting, but I need to check with..."

**Response:**
"Perfect. Let me give you the top 3 things to share with [person]:
1. This reaches 5-10x more employees than traditional matching gifts
2. It's ESG gold�verified impact for annual reporting
3. We handle 95% of the setup�zero burden on your team

Here's my suggestion: I'll send you a 2-page summary and case study. You forward to [person]. If they're interested, we do a 30-minute call with all three of us. Sound good?"

### If They Say "We already have a giving program..."

**Response:**
"I understand. Most companies do. Here's the thing: Traditional matching gifts reach 2-3% of employees. We're seeing companies reach 15-30% with our integrated model.

It's not a replacement�it's an upgrade. Think of it as: Your current program serves your traditional givers. This program reaches everyone else.

Would it be worth a conversation about how the two could coexist?"

### If They Say "Can't approve without [budget cycle/approval]..."

**Response:**
"Great question. When does [Company] typically budget CSR for next fiscal year? [Listen for answer].

Here's my suggestion: Let's start the conversation now, so by the time [cycle] hits, you have all the information you need for quick approval. We can have everything designed and ready to launch immediately after budget approval.

Sound good?"

### If They Ask "How much does this cost?"

**Response:**
"Great question. It depends on the scale you want to go after:

**Conservative approach (BRONZE):** $5K-$25K to test it with 500 employees. If it works, you scale.

**Growth approach (SILVER):** $25K-$75K to launch across your whole company + volunteer days.

**Flagship approach (GOLD):** $75K-$250K to go all-in with matching gifts, volunteer days, ERG partnerships, and custom tech.

Most companies start with SILVER. What feels right for your organization?"

---

## OBJECTION HANDLERS

### "We don't do matching gifts"

**Response:**
"That's actually common. But here's what we're seeing: Companies without matching gifts are leaving massive employee engagement on the table. We can design a simple matching gift program specifically for FOR THE KIDS. Zero complexity. We handle the tech."

### "This seems risky/untested"

**Response:**
"Fair concern. But: We're built on smart contracts�the same technology JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs use for settlements. Blockchain is proven. AND we've already partnered with [Company A], [Company B], [Company C] with great results. I can introduce you to their CSR directors for a reference call. Would that help?"

### "We don't have budget this year"

**Response:**
"I get it. Budget is tight. Here's what I'd suggest: Let's use this conversation to design the program. Then, when you have budget headroom or next fiscal year starts, you're ready to go immediately. No delay. Would that work?"

### "Why pediatric health specifically?"

**Response:**
"Great question. Three reasons:
1. It's universal�everyone cares about kids. No politics.
2. Impact is measurable�we can track exactly how many children are helped.
3. It's underserved�compared to other causes, kids health gets less corporate support.

But here's the real reason: The founder (Joshua) lost a close family member as a kid. This isn't just business�it's mission. That authenticity resonates with employees."

### "Can you prove employees will engage?"

**Response:**
"Absolutely. We have data from [Company Case Study]. Traditional matching gifts got 2% participation. After integrating FOR THE KIDS, participation went to 15%. That's a 7.5x increase.

Here's why: Blockchain transparency + real-time proof + emotional resonance (kids health) = employees want to participate. It's not a theory. It's proven."
