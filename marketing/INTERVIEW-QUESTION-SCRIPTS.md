## INTERVIEW TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS

1. **Build rapport first.** Don't jump into questions. Warm them up.

2. **Ask follow-up questions.** "Tell me more" and "What do you mean by that?" often get the best answers.

3. **Use silence.** Don't fill every pause. Let them think and elaborate.

4. **Listen more than talk.** Interviews are 80% listening, 20% questioning.

5. **Ask for specifics.** "Which specific customer?" not "Do you have customers?"

6. **Get emotions.** "How did that make you feel?" reveals authenticity.

7. **Record permission.** Always explicitly ask and get on tape.

8. **Test tech first.** Nothing worse than perfect interview with no audio.

9. **Have backup plan.** Phone died? Have phone number to call back.

10. **Send thank you.** Same day. Mean it. Mention something specific from interview.
