## DM TEMPLATE SCRIPTS

Use these on Instagram, TikTok, Twitter/X DMs. Personalize with influencer name & recent content reference.

### TEMPLATE 1: THE "MISSION-FIRST" APPROACH (Best for Philanthropy/Parenting niches)
**Use when**: Influencer has charitable content, values-driven messaging
**Conversion rate target**: 25-35%

```
Hey [NAME]! ??

Loved your recent post about [SPECIFIC CONTENT]. Your community clearly values [SHARED VALUE].

We just launched FOR THE KIDS - an AI platform at aidoesitall.website where 60% of ALL revenue goes directly to Verified Pediatric Charities. Not 20%, not 40% - 60%. It's in our founding documents.

We're partnering with creators who align with us, and your audience seems perfect. We'd offer you:
- Affiliate code (20% commission on sales through your link)
- Content brief for an authentic post
- Zero-pressure partnership (no exclusivity)

Would you be open to a quick chat about it?

[YOUR NAME]
```

**Why it works**: Leads with mission, shows specific % (credibility), mentions authentic content permission, removes pressure

---

### TEMPLATE 2: THE "AUDIENCE RELEVANCE" APPROACH (Best for Tech/Lifestyle)
**Use when**: Influencer hasn't engaged with charity but has engaged family
**Conversion rate target**: 20-30%

```
Hey [NAME]! ??

I've been following your content on [TECH/LIFESTYLE TOPIC] and noticed your audience is really engaged. That's rare.

We're launching FOR THE KIDS (aidoesitall.website) - an AI platform that's part marketplace, part movement. The unique angle: 60% of revenue goes to children's hospitals. We built it because we think technology should serve people, not just profit.

For creators like you, we offer:
- 20% affiliate commission
- Pre-written content brief (you keep creative control)
- Track everything yourself (transparent dashboard)

Would you be interested in a 5-min call?

Best,
[YOUR NAME]
```

**Why it works**: Acknowledges engagement (builds rapport), positions as tech + values, transparent metrics emphasis

---

### TEMPLATE 3: THE "QUICK ASK" APPROACH (Best for high-engagement micro-influencers)
**Use when**: You want fast yes/no response, high urgency feel
**Conversion rate target**: 15-25%

```
[NAME] - quick question:

Would you be interested in promoting FOR THE KIDS (aidoesitall.website)?

The pitch: 60% of revenue ? kids' hospitals. We're looking for 10 micro-influencers this month to launch with.

If interested: You'd get 20% affiliate commission + content brief. Takes 1 post.

Yes/No/Ask more?
```

**Why it works**: Respects time, clear call-to-action, urgency creates response, no fluff

---

### TEMPLATE 4: THE "AUTHENTIC COLLABORATION" APPROACH (Best for lifestyle/family niches)
**Use when**: Influencer shows authentic community building, not just sponsored posts
**Conversion rate target**: 28-38%

```
[NAME],

Quick thought: Your community is clearly built on authenticity (I can tell from the comments).

We're building FOR THE KIDS - an AI marketplace where 60% of revenue funds pediatric charities. Here's what makes us different:
- We're not asking you to fake enthusiasm
- We'd send you content brief + access to platform
- You post ONLY if you genuinely think your audience benefits
- 20% affiliate commission on any sales through your link

This is a long-term partnership if we vibe, not a one-off.

Interested in exploring? Happy to hop on a call.

[YOUR NAME]
```

**Why it works**: Respects authenticity, removes pressure, frames as long-term relationship, transparent about process

---

### TEMPLATE 5: THE "NUMBERS & IMPACT" APPROACH (Best for finance/investing niches)
**Use when**: Influencer discusses ROI, metrics, money mindset
**Conversion rate target**: 25-32%

```
[NAME],

Data point: Micro-influencers like you get 8-10x higher engagement than macro-influencers.

We're betting on that. FOR THE KIDS (aidoesitall.website) is an AI platform + charity movement. Here's the model:
- 60% ? Pediatric Charities (Gospel V1.3)
- 30% ? Infrastructure
- 10% ? Founder (intentionally minimal)

For partners:
- 20% affiliate commission (tracked transparently)
- Content brief (your creative)
- Dashboard access (see real-time conversions)

Your audience: [DEMOGRAPHIC]. Our product: [PERFECT FIT].

Call this week?

[YOUR NAME]
```

**Why it works**: Opens with data credibility, shows math (Gospel V1.3), emphasizes transparent tracking, specific demographic match

- Zero pressure - only post if you genuinely believe in it

### EMAIL TEMPLATE 4: THE STORY APPROACH (For values-driven niches)

**Subject**: "Why we built FOR THE KIDS (and why you might want to promote it)"

```
Hi [NAME],

I'm writing because your recent content about [SHARED VALUES] really resonated with how we're thinking about business.

Here's the backstory:

Our founder built FOR THE KIDS (aidoesitall.website) because he believed AI tools should create value for people, not just extract it. He set it up so that 60% of every transaction goes directly to pediatric charities.

That's not a marketing angle - it's in the founding documents. 60% always.

We want to partner with creators who see business as a tool for good. Not influencers who'll say anything for a check, but people like you who have real values.

The offer:
- 20% commission on sales your audience generates
- Full transparency on tracking and payouts
- Content brief you can make your own
- Partnership only if it feels right to you

What made us reach out to you specifically:
[PERSONALIZED REASON BASED ON THEIR CONTENT]

Anyway, I wanted to put this on your radar. No pressure if it's not the right time or fit.

If you're interested, reply and we can chat.

[YOUR NAME]

[SPONSORED] FOR THE KIDS Partnership

I've partnered with FOR THE KIDS as an affiliate. If you use my link, I earn
20% commission. But here's why I'm actually recommending it:

[Your genuine reason]
```

---

### WHAT "CLEAR & CONSPICUOUS" MEANS:

**DON'T DO THIS** ?:
- ? Hide #ad in a wall of hashtags
- ? Say "thanks to our partners" without naming them
- ? Bury disclosure in tiny text
- ? Use vague language like "in partnership with"
- ? Only disclose in "fine print" or comment replies

**DO THIS** ?:
- ? #ad or #sponsored in FIRST 125 characters (visible without "more")
- ? State exactly: "[INFLUENCER NAME] is an affiliate/partner"
- ? Use platform's native disclosure tools
- ? Mention it verbally in videos/podcasts
- ? Make it noticeable (caps, emojis, etc.)

---

### MATERIAL CONNECTION EXPLAINED:

**You MUST disclose**:
- Affiliate commission (you earn %)
- Free product (you received it for free)
- Cash payment (you were paid to promote)
- Discount/special offer for your audience
- Any other "consideration" (free service, traffic, etc.)

**YOU MUST SAY**:
> "I earn commission from every sale through my link"
> OR
> "I'm a paid affiliate partner"

**WHY IT MATTERS**:
- Audience needs to know you benefit financially
- FTC fines: Up to $43,792 per violation (2024 rate)
- Your credibility depends on transparency
- Most audience respects honest disclosure

---

### RECORD KEEPING:

**Keep records of**:
- Dates you posted content
- Screenshots of posts (FTC may audit)
- Commission paid to you
- Conversations with FOR THE KIDS team
- Any edits or revisions to posts

**Why**: FTC enforcement targets both brands and creators. Documentation protects you.

## FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE

Influencers often miss first contact. Here's a structured follow-up plan.

### CONTACT 1: Initial Outreach
- **Day 0**: Send DM or Email (use templates above)
- **Platform**: DM preferred (higher response rate)
- **Tone**: Casual, brief, value-focused
- **Call-to-action**: "Interested?" or "Can we chat?"

### CONTACT 2: First Follow-Up
- **Day 3-5**: Light follow-up DM/Email
- **Message**: "Didn't hear back - here's why this is worth 5 mins of your time"

**DM Template**:
```
Hey [NAME] - just circling back on FOR THE KIDS partnership.

Our creators are getting ~$200-500/month just from one post. Your audience
seems like a great fit.

No pressure, but wanted to make sure you saw it. Happy to answer any Q's.
```

**Email Template**:
```
Subject: Quick follow-up - FOR THE KIDS partnership

Hi [NAME],

Wanted to make sure my last email didn't get lost in your inbox.

No worries if the timing isn't right - but if you're interested in a partnership
where you earn commission + promote something with real impact, let's talk.

[Brief details again]

Talk soon?
```

### CONTACT 3: Value Reframe
- **Day 7-10**: Shift angle to show specific value

**DM Template**:
```
[NAME] - one more thing:

Your audience (highly engaged + values-driven) is literally our perfect demographic.

We're offering 20% commission. Average influencer in your tier makes $200+ per post.

If you want to hear more, I'm around. If not, no hard feelings.
```

### CONTACT 4: Social Proof
- **Day 14-17**: Show others are doing it

**DM Template**:
```
Quick update: We've onboarded 8 creators this week. Several are doing 10-15K per month.

Still think you'd be perfect for this. Last time I'm reaching out - but door's open.

Want to talk?
```

### CONTACT 5: Final Ask
- **Day 21**: Final outreach before moving on

**DM Template**:
```
[NAME] - last message!

Genuinely think you'd crush this. But I respect your time and silence = not interested.

If you ever want to explore FOR THE KIDS partnership, hit me back. Standing offer.

Cheers,
[YOUR NAME]
```

### DON'T CONTACT AGAIN AFTER DAY 21
- Mark as "No Response" in spreadsheet
- Circle back in 90 days (Q2 2026) with updated metrics
- Respect their time; multiple outreach feels spammy

---

```
Awesome! I'm excited about this.

Here's what we'd do:
1. I send you content brief + affiliate code
2. You create 1 post in your authentic style
3. We approve within 24 hours
4. You post, earn commission on any sales from your link
5. Payment via Stripe/PayPal monthly

What questions do you have?

Attached:
1. Content Brief (guidelines, not requirements)
2. Affiliate Code: CREATOR_[NAME]

Questions?

- 25% agreement rate from responses (10 confirmed partners)
- Average 8 clicks per influencer post
- 15% conversion rate (1-2 sales per influencer)
- Average $200-300 commission per influencer
- Total campaign revenue: $2,000-3,000 (first month)

**Quality Metrics**:
- 3%+ engagement rate on posts (micro-influencer standard)
- Authentic content (no copy-paste posts)
- 0% FTC compliance violations
- 95%+ partnership satisfaction (would work again)

---

## GOSPEL V1.3 COMPLIANCE REMINDER

Every transaction funds the mission:
```
60% ? Verified Pediatric Charities (e.g., Shriners, St. Jude, Boston Children's)
30% ? Infrastructure (servers, maintenance, ops)
10% ? Founder compensation (minimal but fair)
```

**This is not marketing copy. It's the law of FOR THE KIDS.**

When promoting to influencers, lead with the 60% metric. That's your differentiator.
