Hi Balaji,

Your writing on network states + crypto-enabled governance inspired this:

We're using smart contracts (planned Q1 2026 Base deployment) to enforce
60% profit allocation to pediatric charities - no DAO vote needed, code is law.

Current: Backend enforcement operational
Future: CharityGuardian.sol makes it immutable

Thesis: Best charities will be crypto-native because blockchain creates
accountability traditional nonprofits can't match.

Wondering if you'd find this model interesting for "Network State"
governance structures - charitable allocation as immutable protocol rule.

Hi Raoul,

Curious about your thoughts on a new crypto primitive:

"Charity-allocated revenue streams" - businesses where profit allocation
to verified charities is enforced by smart contract, not corporate policy.

We're building the first example:
- 60% to pediatric charities (immutable)
- Backend enforcement now, smart contract Q1 2026 on Base
- Creates trust without middlemen

Could this become an investable asset class? Imagine:
- Transparent charitable impact
- Verifiable allocation on-chain
- Sustainable business model
- ESG compliance baked into code

Would love your macro perspective on this.

Hi Laura,

Story idea for Unchained: "Can Smart Contracts Solve Charity Accountability?"

We're building CharityGuardian.sol - backend enforcement active now, smart
contract deployment planned Q1 2026 on Base. 60% of all revenue flows to
verified pediatric charities.

Interesting regulatory angles:
1. How blockchain creates more transparency than traditional nonprofits
2. FTC compliance through verifiable claims (we log everything)
3. Smart contract governance vs. traditional board oversight
4. Crypto's real-world social impact (beyond speculation)

Unlike most crypto projects, we're being radically transparent:
- Backend code is open-source
- All allocation logs publicly accessible
- Smart contract will be verified on BaseScan
- Quarterly impact reports

Would this make a good Unchained episode? Happy to provide background,
technical deep-dive, and regulatory compliance documentation.

**Angle:** Capitalism + social impact
**Probability:** 8-10%

**DM Template:**
```
Hi Chamath,

You talk about "capitalism that works for everyone" - here's a concrete example:

FOR THE KIDS: 60% of profits to pediatric charities, enforced by smart contract
(Q1 2026 Base deployment - backend enforcement currently active).

What makes this different:
- NOT a nonprofit (for-profit LLC with allocated beneficiary)
- NOT charity-first positioning (serious tech platform with charitable mission)
- NOT asking for donations (customers buy products/services)
- Code enforces allocation (not corporate "we promise")

As founder, I take 10% instead of standard 50-70%. Why? Because smart
contracts let me build something more sustainable than traditional charity.

This model could scale to other industries. Imagine:
- SaaS with 60% to climate action
- E-commerce with 60% to education
- DeFi with 60% to public goods

Crypto enables aligned incentives better than any nonprofit structure.

Thoughts?

**DM Template:**
```
Hey Coopa,

Love your work on DAO governance models. Wanted to share an approach
we're taking with CharityGuardian.sol (Q1 2026 Base deployment):

Instead of DAO voting on charity allocation %, we hardcode 60% into
the smart contract. Immutable. No governance attack surface.

Current: Backend enforcement operational
Future: Smart contract makes it trustless

Community DOES vote on:
- Which specific charities receive funds
- Product feature prioritization
- Marketing direction
- Partnership opportunities

Philosophy: Financial allocation = immutable protocol rule
Community governance = everything else

Would this model make sense for public goods DAOs? Curious about your take.

### G. COMMUNITY AMA SCRIPT

**For live AMAs in Discord/Telegram communities**

```
👋 Hey everyone! Thanks for having me for this AMA.

I'm Joshua Coleman, founder of FOR THE KIDS - we're building transparent
pediatric charity allocation on Base using smart contracts.

**Quick intro:**
- 60% of all revenue → verified pediatric charities
- Currently: Backend enforcement with transparent logging
- Q1 2026: CharityGuardian.sol smart contract on Base Mainnet
- Why Base? Sub-cent fees, Coinbase integration, Ethereum security

**Happy to answer questions about:**
✅ Smart contract architecture
✅ Why we chose Base over other chains
✅ How backend allocation currently works
✅ DeFi integration plans (Aave, Yearn yield strategies)
✅ Roadmap to Q1 2026 deployment
✅ Regulatory compliance & transparency
✅ Community involvement opportunities
✅ Partnership possibilities

**NOT looking to:**
❌ Shill a token (we don't have one)
❌ Ask for money (just community support)
❌ Overpromise (radically transparent about current vs. planned)

Fire away with questions! 🔥

FOR THE KIDS 💚

## 5. DEFI PROTOCOL PARTNERSHIP PROPOSALS
### Strategic Integrations for Sustainable Charitable Funding

---

### A. AAVE PROTOCOL PARTNERSHIP

**Contact:** partnerships@aave.com, Aave governance forum
**Proposal Type:** Integration + Ecosystem Grant
**Value Proposition:** "DeFi Lending for Pediatric Charity"

---

### AAVE PARTNERSHIP PROPOSAL

```
PARTNERSHIP PROPOSAL: FOR THE KIDS x AAVE
Sustainable Pediatric Charity Funding Through DeFi Lending

---

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

We propose integrating CharityGuardian.sol with Aave Protocol to create
sustainable, yield-generating charitable funding on Base.

MODEL: Users deposit USDC → Vault supplies to Aave → 60% yield to pediatric charities

ECOSYSTEM VALUE FOR AAVE:
✅ Showcase real-world DeFi utility
✅ Onboard values-driven users to Aave
✅ Positive PR narrative ("Aave helps sick kids")
✅ Template for other social impact DeFi projects
✅ Base ecosystem growth (Aave on Base TVL)

---

TECHNICAL INTEGRATION:

**Phase 1: Basic Integration (Q1 2026)**

CharityGuardian.sol integrates with Aave v3 on Base:

1. User deposits USDC to CharityGuardian vault
2. Vault supplies 90% to Aave (10% kept liquid for withdrawals)
3. Vault earns aUSDC yield (currently ~5-8% APY)
4. Yield auto-compounds or distributes:
   - 60% → Verified pediatric charity wallets
   - 30% → Platform growth & security
   - 10% → User retention rewards (optional)

**Phase 2: Advanced Features (Q2 2026)**

5. Multi-asset support (USDT, DAI, ETH)
6. Automated rebalancing based on Aave rates
7. Flash loan integration for instant liquidity
8. Risk management (automatic de-risking during volatility)

**Smart Contract Architecture:**

```solidity
contract CharityGuardianAaveVault {
    IAavePool public aavePool;
    uint256 public constant CHARITY_BPS = 6000; // 60%

    function deposit(uint256 amount) external {
        // User deposits USDC
        usdc.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

        // Supply 90% to Aave
        uint256 aaveAmount = amount * 9000 / 10000;
        aavePool.supply(USDC, aaveAmount, address(this), 0);

        emit Deposited(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function harvestYield() external {
        // Calculate accrued interest
        uint256 yield = calculateYield();

        // Distribute yield
        uint256 charityShare = yield * CHARITY_BPS / 10000;
        distributeToCharities(charityShare);

        emit YieldHarvested(yield, charityShare);
    }
}
```

---

## FINAL NOTES: TRANSPARENCY & HONESTY

**CRITICAL: Gospel V1.3 Compliance**

All crypto community outreach MUST maintain radical transparency:

✅ **HONEST CLAIMS ONLY:**
- "Backend enforcement currently active"
- "Smart contract planned Q1 2026"
- "CharityGuardian.sol in development"
- "Transparent allocation logging operational"

❌ **NO FALSE CLAIMS:**
- Do NOT claim smart contract is deployed (until it actually is)
- Do NOT share fake contract addresses
- Do NOT promise "trustless" until contract is live
- Do NOT link to BaseScan verification (until contract exists)

**Template Language:**

Instead of: "Smart contract enforces 60% allocation"
Use: "Backend enforces 60% allocation (smart contract planned Q1 2026)"

Instead of: "Verify on BaseScan"
Use: "View transparency dashboard (on-chain verification planned Q1 2026)"

Instead of: "Trustless allocation"
Use: "Transparent allocation (smart contract enforcement planned Q1 2026)"

## CRYPTO COMMUNITY VALUES ALIGNMENT

**Why This Approach Works:**

1. **Transparency:** Crypto community values honesty over hype
2. **Code is Law:** Promise of smart contracts resonates deeply
3. **Real Utility:** Solving actual problems (charity accountability)
4. **Technical Merit:** Strong technical architecture attracts developers
5. **Mission-Driven:** Values-driven builders support impact projects

**Community-First Approach:**

- Build relationships before making asks
- Provide value to communities (technical insights, participation)
- Be radically transparent about current vs. planned features
- Honor Gospel V1.3 commitment to 60% allocation
- Make smart contract open-source for community verification
