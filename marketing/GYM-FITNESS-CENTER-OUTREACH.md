- 4,000+ affiliated CrossFit boxes
- Extremely high engagement & community
- Strong charitable culture (WODs for causes)

### "Charity WOD" Monthly Program

#### How It Works

```

2. Each month: New branded "FOR THE KIDS Charity WOD"
3. Every affiliated box runs same WOD on same day (nationally)
4. Entry fee: $25-50 per participant
5. T-shirt add-on: $20 (profit ? FOR THE KIDS)
6. National leaderboard: Aggregate scores, crown champions
7. Revenue split: 10% box, 30% infrastructure, 60% kids
```

#### Sample WOD: "Kids Strong"

```
"21-15-9 for time:
- Thrusters (95/65 lbs)
- Pull-ups
- Box Jumps (24/20")
- 400m run between rounds

Time cap: 30 minutes
Scaled options available (modify weight/movement as needed)"

Plus T-shirts: 15,000 shirts � $15 profit = $225,000
TOTAL MONTHLY: $975,000

ALLOCATION:
- 60% to pediatric charities: $585,000
- 30% infrastructure: $292,500
- 10% founder: $97,500
- Boxes keep 10%: $97,500

YEARLY POTENTIAL: $11.7M revenue
= $7M to pediatric charities
= 280,000 children directly helped
```

### CrossFit Box Outreach Email

```
Subject: Monthly Charity WOD = Recurring Revenue for Your Box (FOR THE KIDS)

Hi [Box Owner Name],

Your athletes are strong. They're also generous. Every month, they want
to push themselves for a purpose bigger than themselves.

FOR THE KIDS partners with CrossFit boxes to host monthly "Charity WODs"
where every box runs the same workout, same day, nationwide.

THE OPPORTUNITY:

Each Month:
? New branded WOD (FOR THE KIDS designs it)
? 50+ participants in your box
? $25-50 entry fee per athlete
? $20 T-shirt sales
? National leaderboards
? Community recognition

YOUR BOX GETS:
- 10% of entry fees = $125-250 per WOD = $1,500-3,000/year
- 30% of T-shirt profits = $90/month = $1,080/year
- TOTAL: $2,500-4,000/year recurring revenue
- FREE: All marketing, logistics, leaderboard management
- FREE: Official "FOR THE KIDS Partner" branding
- ZERO SETUP: We provide all materials

EXAMPLE ECONOMICS:

50 athletes � $30 entry = $1,500 revenue
- 20 T-shirts � $20 = $400 additional

Your Cut (10% entry + 30% shirts):
$150 (entry) + $120 (shirts) = $270/month
$3,240/year from single monthly WOD

Scale to 12 WODs/year:
$270 � 12 = $3,240 in recurring revenue

ATHLETES GET:
- Community competition (national leaderboard)
- Meaningful purpose (kids helped)
- For every point scored = 1 child helped (visual)
- Post-WOD impact report ("This WOD helped 2,400 children")

COMMUNITY BENEFITS:
- Positive PR ("CrossFit boxes raise $X for children's hospitals")
- Athlete recruitment ("Our box supports kids")
- Media coverage (local press loves charitable stories)
- Loyalty boost (members feel good about gym choice)

FIRST WOD LAUNCH:
- January 2026: Recruitment begins
- February 1: First "Kids Strong" WOD
- Recurring: Monthly on designated day

WHY THIS WORKS:

CrossFit is built on community and pushing limits. Charity WODs let athletes
do both. It's authentic to CrossFit culture, not forced.

Your athletes WANT to do this. You just need to make it easy.
