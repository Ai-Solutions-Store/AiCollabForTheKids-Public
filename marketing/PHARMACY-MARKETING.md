**HOW IT WORKS**

```

¦ "Would you like to support children  ¦
¦ in your community? Round up your     ¦

4. **Operational Support** - 30% revenue from round-ups helps pharmacies
5. **Tax Benefits** - Charitable giving component
6. **Ease of Implementation** - Works with existing POS systems

**FINANCIAL PROJECTION (National Rollout)**

```
Assumptions:
• 9,000 pharmacy locations (CVS example)
• 500 customers/day per location
• 10% opt-in rate for round-up
• Average round-up: $5/transaction

Daily Transactions:
9,000 × 500 × 0.10 × $5 = $225,000/day

Monthly Impact:
$225,000 × 30 days = $6,750,000

Annual Impact to Pediatric Charities:
$6,750,000 × 12 × 0.60 = $48,600,000/year

Annual Pharmacy Network Benefit:
$6,750,000 × 12 × 0.30 = $24,300,000/year
```

**PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURE**

CUSTOMER PERCEPTION:
"I want to support kids' hospitals"

Current Reality:

• No easy mechanism
• Feels like extra burden

FOR THE KIDS + Your Pharmacy:
• Simple, frictionless opportunity
• Every prescription = potential giving
• Zero extra effort required
• Measurable impact

Result: Your pharmacy becomes the "pharmacy that cares"
```

**REAL-WORLD IMPACT STORY**

```
Imagine Maria, CVS customer:
- Fills prescriptions monthly for family
- Wants to support children's hospitals
- Discovers round-up program at checkout
- Opts in: "Sure, round me up"
- Contributes $5 per prescription (5x/month)
- Monthly contribution: $25
- Annual contribution: $300
- Annual hospital benefit (60%): $180

Multiply across 9,000 pharmacies:
9,000 pharmacies × 500 Marias = 4.5M engaged customers
Potential annual impact: $48M+ to pediatric hospitals
```

**WHY PARTNERS SHOULD CHOOSE THIS OVER TRADITIONAL CSR**

| Aspect | Traditional CSR | FOR THE KIDS Model |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Control | Corporate decides | Customers choose |
| Scale | Limited contributions | Millions of opportunities |
| Engagement | Annual giving | Daily interaction |
| Transparency | General reporting | Blockchain verified |
| Customer Impact | Feels distant | Immediate and visible |
| Sustainability | Annual budget cycle | Ongoing revenue stream |

**NEXT STEPS**

I'd like to schedule a meeting with your CSR and corporate pharmacy leadership to discuss:

1. Detailed financial modeling for your specific chain
2. POS system integration requirements
3. Marketing and rollout strategy
4. Legal and compliance framework
5. Hospital partnership coordination
6. Implementation timeline

This partnership could transform pharmacy CSR from annual contributions to structural, everyday giving - with direct benefits to your operations, your customers' experience, and pediatric hospitals nationwide.

## SECTION 6: Rx CHARITY ROUND-UP PROGRAM

### Program Overview

The Rx Charity Round-Up is the simplest, most elegant charitable giving mechanism: customers opt to round up their prescription total to the nearest dollar, with the difference supporting pediatric charities.

**Why Round-Up Works:**

```
Psychological Research on Giving:

BARRIER TO GIVING: "I have to think about a specific amount"
ROUND-UP SOLUTION: "Automatic, tiny amounts"

Results:
• 3-5x higher participation rate than contribution asks
• Lower average gift ($1-5) but 10x higher aggregate
• Repeat participation becomes habitual
• Customers feel good about small, painless contribution
```

### Point-of-Sale Implementation

**At Pharmacy Checkout:**

## SECTION 9: SPECIALTY PHARMACY PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM

### Specialty Pharmacy Focus

Specialty pharmacies focus on complex medications:
- Compounded medications
- Biologics for chronic conditions
- Orphan drugs (rare diseases)
- Cancer medications
- Respiratory and immunology drugs

**Why Specialty Pharmacies Matter:**
- Higher transaction values ($500-$5,000+)
- Patients with chronic pediatric conditions
- Strong patient relationships
- Need for community support
- Direct impact on quality of life

### Specialty Pharmacy Partnership Email

---

**To:** [Specialty Pharmacy Owner/Director]
**From:** Joshua Coleman, Founder - FOR THE KIDS Campaign
**Subject:** Specialty Pharmacy Partnership - Transform Patient Outcomes + Support Kids' Hospitals

Dear [Specialty Pharmacy Leader],

Specialty pharmacies serve patients with complex medical needs. FOR THE KIDS is proposing a partnership that acknowledges your role in pediatric care while supporting the hospitals treating children's complex conditions.

**THE OPPORTUNITY**

Specialty pharmacies see children with serious illnesses - leukemia, cystic fibrosis, rare genetic disorders. Many of these children received care at pediatric hospitals.

FOR THE KIDS proposes that a percentage of specialty pharmacy revenue supports the pediatric hospitals and charities treating these complex conditions.

**PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURE**

```
Patient fills specialty prescription
($500-$2,000 average value)

FOR THE KIDS allocation:
60% ? Pediatric hospitals treating the condition
30% ? Pharmacy operations
10% ? Platform sustainability

Example: $1,000 specialty medication
$600 ? Pediatric Hospital Foundation
$300 ? Specialty Pharmacy
$100 ? Platform
```

**WHY THIS WORKS FOR SPECIALTY PHARMACIES**

1. **Patient Engagement** - Deepens relationships through shared mission
2. **Reimbursement Help** - 60% funding helps hospitals support patients
3. **Community Reputation** - Positions pharmacy as community health leader
4. **Patient Outcomes** - Funded hospitals provide better care to your patients
5. **Cyclical Support** - Your patients benefit from hospital funding you help generate

**BENEFITS FOR YOUR PATIENTS**

If a child is taking an expensive specialty medication ($500-2,000/month):
- 60% of that medication cost supports the pediatric hospital
- Hospital receives funding for patient care programs
- Same hospital may be treating child's underlying condition
- Creates supportive ecosystem for patient care

**REAL EXAMPLE: CYSTIC FIBROSIS CASE**

Alex, 8 years old, has cystic fibrosis:
- Receives care at Children's Hospital (CF center)
- Takes specialty medications: $2,000/month
- Specialty pharmacy fills his prescriptions

Current Reality:
- Hospital and pharmacy operate separately
- No funding connection between medication cost and hospital support

FOR THE KIDS Model:
- OF every $2,000 prescription
- $1,200 goes to Children's Hospital (60%)
- Hospital uses funds for CF programs, patient support, research
- Same hospital treating Alex benefits from medication funding
- Alex's family sees their medication cost supporting his care center

---

**COMPOUNDING PHARMACY SPECIALTY ANGLE**

For compounding pharmacies specifically:

- Customized medications for pediatric patients
- Often treat rare conditions
- Direct patient-pharmacy relationships
- Higher price points allow for greater impact

**Compounding Pharmacy Partnership:**

```
Compounding Pharmacy + FOR THE KIDS:

Example: Customized pain relief suspension for child
Traditional compounded price: $150

FOR THE KIDS Model:
Customer Price: $150
