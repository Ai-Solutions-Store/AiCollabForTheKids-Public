- **Publication rate:** 12-15% (expected)
- **Quotes published:** 3-5 per month
- **Unique publications:** 8-12 per month

15% publication rate = 54 quotes published/year
Average reach per article = 10,000 people
Average value per article = $5,000 earned media
Total annual value: $270,000 earned media
```

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Responding too slowly** - Send in first 2 hours for 35% publication rate
2. **Responding to poor fit queries** - Score is your friend, skip low scores
3. **Generic responses** - Customize journalist name + specific angle
4. **Missing Gospel V1.3 compliance** - Check 60%, 10%, V1.3 every time
5. **Not tracking follow-ups** - Spreadsheet is essential
6. **Ignoring published articles** - Follow-up email within 1 hour
7. **Not sharing published quotes** - Social media share immediately
8. **Forgetting to update press kit** - Add new coverage monthly
9. **Skipping journalist relationship building** - Send monthly updates to Tier 1
10. **Not optimizing based on data** - Review quarterly what works, double down

## FINAL REMINDERS

**Gospel V1.3 is the foundation**
Every response, every angle, every template must reinforce:
- 60% to kids' hospitals
- 10% to founder (reduced from 20%)
- DAO-enforced, unchangeable
- Verified, transparent, immutable

**Speed is critical**
First 2 hours = 35% publication rate
After 8:00 AM = 15% publication rate
Speed matters more than perfection

**Quality beats quantity**
Better to send 5 perfect responses than 20 mediocre ones
Score each query: only respond to 10+ scores
Skip low-fit queries (save time for winners)

**Relationships matter**
Build list of journalists who quote you
Send monthly updates to Tier 1
Offer yourself as permanent resource
Build 10-20 relationships over time

**Measure everything**
Track responses, publications, reach, value
Review monthly: what worked, what didn't
Optimize quarterly: double down on winners
Celebrate wins: share published articles
