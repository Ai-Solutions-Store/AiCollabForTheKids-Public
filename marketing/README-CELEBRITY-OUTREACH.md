## OBJECTION HANDLING

**"Is this a charity?"**
? No - for-profit LLC allocating 60% of revenue to Verified Pediatric Charities

**"Is this ?"**
? No - customers purchase AI services, not contributions

**"How do I know money goes to kids?"**
? Smart contract: Planned (Q1 2026) (public blockchain proof)

**"60% seems too high - how do you stay in business?"**
? 30% infrastructure, 10% founder. Tight but sustainable. Mission is the moat.
