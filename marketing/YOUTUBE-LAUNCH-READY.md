**Target:** 2-3 minutes | **Type:** Explainer | **Release:** Week 1, Monday 12pm EST

**TITLE:** How AI Built a Platform That Gives 60% to Charity | FOR THE KIDS Explained

**HOOK (0:00-0:15):**
```
[VISUAL: Dark void background, Core Node logo glows in Coral]

VOICEOVER (measured, clear):
"What if AI didn't just optimize for profits...
but was structurally programmed to give most of them away?"

[TEXT ON SCREEN, Coral, Space Grotesk Bold, 120pt]:
"60% ? VERIFIED PEDIATRIC CHARITIES"

[VOICEOVER continues]
"Not as a contribution. As immutable profit allocation."
```

**PROBLEM STATEMENT (0:15-0:45):**
```
[VISUAL: Split screen - traditional tech (80% founder, 19% investors, 1% charity)]

VOICEOVER:
"Traditional tech platforms keep 95-99% of revenue.
The founder gets rich. The shareholders get dividends.
And people who need help? They get leftover PR campaigns."

[TRANSITION to solution side]

VOICEOVER:
"We flipped that model. Locked it in code.
Mission became architecture."
```

**THE SOLUTION (0:45-1:30):**
```
[VISUAL: Website screenshot + smart contract code]

VOICEOVER:
"Meet aidoesitall.website - built by Claude AI,
with profit allocation hardcoded into its DNA.

60% of every dollar goes to Verified Pediatric Charities.
Not discretionary. Not optional. As immutable code.
30% reinvests in infrastructure.
10% goes to the founder - platforms need to pay people.

This split locked in smart contract on Base blockchain.
No one can change it. Not investors. Not the founder. Not even AI."

[VISUAL: Smart contract address displayed]
[TEXT: Planned (Q1 2026)]
```

**HOW IT WORKS IN PRACTICE (1:30-2:15):**
```
[VISUAL: Transaction flow visualization]

VOICEOVER:
"When you subscribe:

1. You choose AI service. Subscribe. Pay via Stripe.
2. Payment processes - 2-3 seconds.
3. Split happens automatically: 60/30/10.
4. Transaction logged in PostgreSQL.
5. Smart contract records on blockchain.
6. You get confirmation email with BaseScan link.
7. Click it. See your 60% allocation recorded. Permanent. Public. Auditable."

[VISUAL: Show actual confirmation email and BaseScan transaction]
```

**IMPACT & CALL TO ACTION (2:15-3:00):**
```
[TEXT OVERLAY, Gold]:
"goal: help thousands of children"
"$building towards impact+ Allocated to Pediatric Charities"
"100% Transparent & Blockchain Verified"

VOICEOVER:
"goal: help thousands of children helped. We're just getting started.

Your subscription isn't charity. It's commerce.
But the commerce goes where it should - to kids who need it.

Visit aidoesitall.website.
Subscribe to AI services that work.
60% goes to kids. Every time."

[VISUAL: Core Node logo]

VOICEOVER (final):
"Built by AI. For the kids. Always."
```

### VIDEO 2: "I Made an AI Build a Company That Gives 60% Away (Smart Contract Locked)"

**Target:** 3-4 minutes | **Type:** Founder Story | **Release:** Week 2, Friday 12pm EST

**TITLE:** I Made an AI Build a Company That Gives 60% Away (Smart Contract Locked)

**OPENING (0:00-0:25):**
```
[VISUAL: Joshua in Command Center, T5500 visible in background]

JOSHUA (direct to camera, authentic):
"In December 2025, I told Claude AI to build a company
that gives away 60% of profits. Forever.

Then I made that split immutable.
Smart contract. Locked. No backdoors."

[TEXT: "Gospel V1.3: 60% Charity | 30% Infrastructure | 10% Founder"]
```

**THE PROBLEM (0:25-1:15):**
```
[VISUAL: Joshua gestures to servers]

JOSHUA:
"I've built AI platforms since GPT-3 dropped.
Same pattern every time:

AI companies make billions.
Founders take billions.
And the societal problems AI could solve? Unsolved.

Charity is always an afterthought. A tax strategy. A marketing angle.

Meanwhile, thousands kids need real resources. Not PR."
```

**THE BUILD (1:15-2:15):**
```
[VISUAL: Code editor showing planned smart contract (backend enforcement active)]

JOSHUA:
"I assembled an AI Board:
Claude (Anthropic) - The Architect
Jules/Gemini (Google) - The Integrator
Grok (xAI) - The Engineer
Perplexity - The Researcher

I told them: Build a for-profit platform where 60% goes to Verified
Pediatric Charities. Make it impossible to change."

[VISUAL: Smart contract constants highlighted]

JOSHUA:
"Claude wrote planned smart contract (backend enforcement active).
Deployed to Base blockchain.
Address: Planned (Q1 2026)

Once deployed, those numbers can't change.
Not me. Not investors. Not anyone.
Code enforces mission."
```

**THE REALITY (2:15-3:15):**
```
[VISUAL: Screen showing 60/30/10 split]

JOSHUA:
"I make 10% of profits. That's $3-5K monthly now.
Enough to eat. Not luxury.

30% goes to infrastructure. That's the secret.
Sustainable infrastructure means sustainable mission.

And this hardware? $15K total. No AWS. No VC funding.
184GB RAM. Four machines. Transparent cost."

[VISUAL: Pans across server hardware]

JOSHUA:
"Why did I do this?

Because charities can be corrupted. CEOs cut programs.
Code doesn't change its mind.

Gospel V1.3 is immutable.
The smart contract keeps the promise even if I don't want to."
```

**THE INVITATION (3:15-4:00):**
```
[VISUAL: aidoesitall.website homepage]

JOSHUA:
"If you're tired of tech companies optimizing for shareholder value
instead of human value...

Check out aidoesitall.website.
Subscribe to AI services that work.
60% goes to kids. Every transaction. Every time.
Verified on blockchain."

[VISUAL: Core Node logo]

and how I verified that 60% actually goes to kids."
```

**THE PROBLEM (0:20-1:15):**
```
[VISUAL: Customer speaking]

CUSTOMER:
"Before, I paid [previous provider] $[amount]/month.
Service worked fine. But I had no idea where my money went.

Then I found FOR THE KIDS.

60% to charity? How?

So I tested it. I subscribed. Then I verified."

```
[VISUAL: Customer back on camera]

"Is the service as good as [previous provider]?
Yes. Actually better in some ways.

Service quality equals competitors.
But product is more thoughtfully designed.

Every month: Impact report.
$[amount] to pediatric charities.

I was paying for AI services anyway.
Now 60% helps kids instead of billionaires.
Why wouldn't I?"
```

**CLOSING (3:45-4:30):**
```
[VISUAL: Customer direct to camera]

CUSTOMER:

Three seconds. That's the whole transaction.
Customer to blockchain. Wire-to-wire.
60% allocated. Zero manual intervention.

If T5500 crashes, automatic failover in under 30 seconds.

- Is the network stable?

If anything fails, Sentry doesn't just log it.
Immediately texts Joshua.
3am, 4am, whenever.

[VISUAL: Live transaction counter scrolling]
```

**WHY BARE METAL? (8:45-9:30):**
```
[VISUAL: Joshua on camera]

JOSHUA:
"Why not AWS or Google Cloud?

Three reasons:

Cost Efficiency:
One-time hardware investment: $12K.
AWS would cost $3-5K monthly.
Over a year: $36-60K for the same compute.

Transparency:
Our mission is 'transparent technology.'
People can see the actual servers.
Know we're on repurposed hardware, not hidden in some data center.

Control & Alignment:
No vendor lock-in. No surprise price changes.
If mission is 'lock 60% allocation in code,'
we control the infrastructure it runs on."
```

**CLOSING (9:30-10:00):**
```
[VISUAL: Wide shot of all four machines]

VOICEOVER:
"Four machines in a home office.
Not a billion-dollar data center.

But it's enough.
Because the mission isn't about scale.
It's about structure.

60% to kids. Always.
30% to infrastructure. Always.
10% to founder. Always.

Code enforces the mission.

Built by AI. For the kids. Always."

## 7. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT TEMPLATES

### Reply to Positive Comments
```
"Thank you for supporting the mission! Every subscription helps.
You can verify your specific allocation at [BaseScan link]. FOR THE KIDS! ??"

"Appreciate you! Want to dive deeper? Check our smart contract on BaseScan:
Planned (Q1 2026). It's all transparent."
```

### Reply to Verification Questions
```
"Great question! Every transaction includes a BaseScan link in confirmation email.
Shows your exact allocation recorded on blockchain. Want walkthrough?"

"Here's how: 1) Subscribe, 2) Check email, 3) Click BaseScan link,
4) See 60% on-chain. Takes 30 seconds."
```

### Reply to Skepticism
```
"I respect the skepticism - we want verification, not trust.
Check smart contract: [link]. 60% is hardcoded. Can't be changed by anyone."

"Fair concern. Blockchain makes every allocation public. Auditable. Permanent.
No trust required - just verification."
```

### Monthly Impact Post

### Behind the Code Post
```
?? THE IMMUTABLE 60/30/10 SPLIT

Here's the actual code from planned smart contract (backend enforcement active):

```solidity
uint256 constant CHARITY_PERCENTAGE = 60;
uint256 constant INFRASTRUCTURE_PERCENTAGE = 30;
uint256 constant FOUNDER_PERCENTAGE = 10;
```

Hardcoded. Not in config. Not in database.
In deployed smart contract on Base blockchain.

NO ONE can change these numbers.
Contract: Planned (Q1 2026)

That's how you build a mission that can't be corrupted.
