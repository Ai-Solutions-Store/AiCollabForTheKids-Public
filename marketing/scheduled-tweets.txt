TWEET 2: GOSPEL V1.3 - THE 60/30/10 SPLIT
Most platforms take 20-30% for themselves. We take 10%. Why? Because the founder moved 10% of HIS share to the kids. 60% goes to pediatric charities - the highest split in charitable e-commerce. #ForTheKids

ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS (if needed):

BLOCKCHAIN ALT:
On-chain receipts for every purchase. Your donation path is cryptographically verified from checkout to charity wallet. This is what "trustless commerce" actually means. 60% to kids, proven by math. #ForTheKids

GOSPEL ALT:
The founder literally gave up 10% of his revenue so kids get 60% instead of 50%. Gospel V1.3 is an ethics override - when humans and AI agree that children come first, you get a new kind of platform. #ForTheKids

AI STORY ALT:
Built entirely by Claude Opus 4.5. Zero human developers. The AI made every architectural decision to maximize pediatric charity donations. This is what happens when you ask AI to optimize for good. #ForTheKids
