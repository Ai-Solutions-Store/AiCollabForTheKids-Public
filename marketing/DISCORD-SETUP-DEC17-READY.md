This community is FOR you, not AT you.

**FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS.**

*Gospel V1.3 | 60% Charity | 30% Infrastructure | 10% Founder*
*Immutable. Transparent. FOR THE KIDS.*
```

---

### 3.2 Gospel V1.3 Reference (Pin in #gospel-v13-reference)

```markdown
# Gospel V1.3: The Complete Framework

## THE IMMUTABLE COMMITMENT

```
60% of FOR THE KIDS revenue ? Verified 501(c)(3) pediatric charities
30% ? Infrastructure, scaling, operations
10% ? Founder sustainability (preventing burnout)
```

This is not "up to 60%". This is EXACTLY 60% or the platform shuts down.

## WHY THESE NUMBERS?

### 60% to Charity (Maximum Impact)

**Why Pediatric Charities?**
- Pediatric healthcare is underfunded relative to adult medicine
- Children's hospitals operate on tight, unpredictable budgets
- One-time contributions create feast/famine cycles
- Kids deserve the same quality care as adults

**Why 60% (not 70% or 50%)?**
- It's the maximum sustainable allocation while maintaining operations
- Prevents platform collapse from unsustainable margins
- Allows for growth infrastructure (can't scale impact without growth)
- Still leaves enough for infrastructure and founder survival

**Why Recurring Revenue?**
- Most nonprofits operate on unpredictable revenue cycles
- Sustainable, monthly funding is better than one-time grants
- Charities can plan, hire, invest with predictable income
- This is structurally better for pediatric care outcomes

### 30% to Infrastructure (Growth Engine)

**Why Infrastructure Matters**
- Servers, hiring, product development don't cost 0%
- Customer support, security, reliability require investment
- Marketing and growth enable us to help more kids
- Can't scale impact without scaling operations

**Breakdown**
- Servers & hosting: ~8%
- Hiring & salaries: ~10%
- Product development: ~5%
- Marketing & growth: ~4%
- Security & compliance: ~2%
- Customer support: ~1%

**This Is Not Bloat**
Without infrastructure investment, we'd have:
- Slow, unreliable platform (lose customers)
- No growth (helps fewer kids)
- No hiring (founder burnout)
- Mediocre product (people leave)

### 10% to Founder (Sustainability)

**Why The Founder Gets Paid**
- Starting a charity-focused business requires sacrifice
- Living on ramen isn't sustainable long-term
- Founder burnout = mission failure (80% of charity startups die in year 3)
- Forcing founder poverty only works if you're already wealthy (inequality)

**Why 10% (not 0% or 15%)?**
- 0% = only rich people can start impact-driven businesses
- 10% = minimum for founder to not need a side job
- 15% would feel extractive (not the mission)
- 10% is the sweet spot: sustainable, not excessive

**This Is Not Greedy**
Compare to typical startups:
- VC-backed startup founder: 20-30% equity stake
- Traditional business owner: 60%+ of profits
- Our founder: 10% LOCKED IN

We chose to give kids MORE so the founder gets LESS.

## HOW IT'S ENFORCED

This isn't just policy. It's architecture.

**1. Smart Contract Level**
- planned smart contract (backend enforcement active) deployment planned for Q1 2026 (backend allocation currently active)
- Address: Planned (Q1 2026)
- Every transaction verified on blockchain
- Code is immutable and auditable by anyone

**2. Backend Level**
- Code in api/server.js enforces 60/30/10 split
- If split is violated, payment webhook fails
- No money moves unless split is correct

**3. Monthly Transparency Reports**
- Full breakdown of allocations
- Posted in #impact-stories
- Publicly accessible
- No hiding, no creative accounting

**4. Quarterly Third-Party Audits**
- Independent financial verification
- Charity partner interviews
- Public audit results
- Professional validation

**5. Governance**
- If we ever violate 60%, platform shuts down (literally)
- Smart contract has kill-switch that triggers
- Not aspirational, not "we'll try"
- Structural enforcement

## GOSPEL V1.3 VS. OTHER MODELS

### vs. Typical Charity

**Traditional Charity:**
- 60-80% overhead (salaries, admin)
- 20-40% actually reach mission
- One-time fundraising cycles
- Founder usually unpaid (burnout risk)

**FOR THE KIDS:**
- 60% reaches verified pediatric charities
- 30% is operational excellence (not bloat)
- 10% is founder sustainability
- Recurring, predictable funding for charities

### vs. Corporate Social Responsibility

**Corporate CSR:**
- "We allocate 1% of profits"
- Often used for marketing/optics
- No structural enforcement
- Can change any year

**FOR THE KIDS:**
- 60% allocated structurally (hardcoded)
- Cannot change, even under pressure
- Blockchain verifiable
- FOR THE KIDS, always

### vs. Other Impact-Driven Platforms

**Other Models:**
- "We'll aim for 60% to charity"
- "We hope to allocate contributions"
- Aspirational but not guaranteed

**Gospel V1.3:**
- "We literally cannot give less than 60%"
- Enforced at smart contract level
- Immutable forever
- That's the difference

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Why is the split immutable?**
A: Because if we could change it, we would (under pressure). Making it immutable is the only way to make the promise credible.

**Q: What if the business struggles?**
A: The 60/30/10 split never changes. If we're struggling, we might reduce overall spending, but we never reduce the 60% allocation percentage.

**Q: How do I know this is real?**
A: Verify it yourself:
1. Check the smart contract on BaseScan
2. Review our monthly reports in #impact-stories
3. Read the GOSPEL.md file in our documentation
4. Ask hard questions (we want scrutiny)

**Q: What if you get acquired?**
A: Smart contract makes that impossible. Any acquirer inherits the 60/30/10 obligation forever.

**Q: Why not make it 70% or 80%?**
A: Because 60% is the maximum sustainable allocation while maintaining operational health. Going higher risks platform failure, which helps 0 kids.

**Q: Can members vote to change the split?**
A: No. This is immutable by design. Not even the founder can change it. Community input shapes *how* we execute, not the core Gospel.

**Q: What if there's an emergency?**
A: The split never changes. Emergencies are handled by cutting other expenses, not reducing the 60% allocation.

## THE PHILOSOPHY

Gospel V1.3 is built on one principle:

**Business success should automatically mean kids get better healthcare.**

Not "might" or "could" or "we hope to".

**Automatically.**

That's the whole philosophy. That's why we exist.

Welcome to the FOR THE KIDS community!

This is day 1 of something that matters.

We're building a platform where business success automatically means kids get better healthcare. Gospel V1.3 guarantees 60% of our revenue goes to verified pediatric charities.

Not "up to 60%". Not "we hope to give 60%".

Exactly 60%. Enforced at the smart contract level.

I'm here personally to answer any questions, hear your feedback, and build this movement together.

Start by introducing yourself in #introductions. Tell us:
- What's your background?
- Why did you join FOR THE KIDS?
- What would you like to see from this community?

FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS.

- Joshua Coleman (Founder)
```

- Monitor for any issues

---

### Day 2 - Gospel Deep Dive

**Post in #general (Morning):**
```markdown
Day 2: Let's talk about Gospel V1.3

Many people ask: "Why 60%? Why not 70% or 80%?"

The short answer: Math + reality.

**60% to Charity:**
- It's the maximum we can give while keeping operations healthy
- Pediatric care is underfunded vs. adult medicine
- Most nonprofits operate feast/famine
- Sustainable, recurring funding > one-time contributions

**30% to Infrastructure:**
- Servers, hiring, product dev, support, marketing
- Can't scale impact without scaling operations
- This isn't bloat - it's what enables growth

**10% to Founder:**
- 80% of charity startups die in year 3 (founder burnout)
- Having zero founder allocation only works if you're already rich
- 10% = minimum for me to not need a side job
- It's sustainable, not extractive

**The Lock:**
These aren't guidelines. They're enforced at the smart contract level.
If we break this, the platform shuts down. Literally.

That's Gospel V1.3. That's the whole philosophy.

Questions? Challenges? I *want* scrutiny. The stronger our model, the better.

Check #gospel-v13-reference for the full framework.
```

### 7.6 Special Case: Gospel V1.3 Challenges

**These are ALWAYS welcome - not violations**

**Healthy Gospel Challenges:**
- "Why 60% instead of 80%?" ? ENCOURAGE debate
- "Could we make the founder allocation 15%?" ? WELCOME discussion
- "Is 30% infrastructure too much?" ? ENGAGE deeply
- "Prove the smart contract actually works" ? VERIFY with evidence

**Action:** Engage respectfully in #gospel-v13-reference or #general, don't moderate

**Philosophy:** We want scrutiny. Strong community members challenge us. This strengthens the Gospel.

**Red Line:**
- Spreading false Gospel info ? enforce
- Asking hard questions ? celebrate

### 7.7 Gospel V1.3 Messaging Standards

**CORRECT Messaging:**
? "60% to charity" (exact)
? "10% to founder" (exact)
? "Gospel V1.3" (current version)
? "60/30/10 split" (correct)
? "Profit allocation" (not treasury)
? "Revenue split" (not contribution)

**INCORRECT Messaging (Must Correct):**
? "60% to charity"
? "20% to founder"
? "Gospel V1.3"
? "60/30/10 split"
? "treasury system"
? "contribution platform"

**If Someone Posts Incorrect Info:**
1. Correct gently in thread
2. Link to #gospel-v13-reference
3. DM them: "Hey! Just a heads up - it's 60% not 60%. Check #gospel-v13-reference for the accurate framework."
4. NO warning unless deliberate/repeated
