## 2. SLACK/TEAMS MESSAGE TEMPLATES

### Template A: Quick Announcement (Casual Teams)

```
Hey team! 👋

I wanted to share something I'm excited about: FOR THE KIDS - an AI collaboration platform where **60% of all revenue goes directly to verified pediatric charities**.

It's a win-win: better AI tools for productivity + helping kids in need. The founder literally took a pay cut to give more to charity (moved from 20% to 10% so kids get 60% instead of 50%). That kind of ethics is rare.

Check it out: [Link]

Quick ask: Does anyone know if [Company Name] does matching gifts for tech platforms or charitable initiatives? Could double our impact!

### Template B: Professional Announcement (Corporate Channels)

```
Hi everyone,

I'd like to share a mission-driven initiative I'm supporting: FOR THE KIDS - an AI collaboration platform with a unique charitable model.

**Key Details:**
- 60% of all revenue → Verified pediatric charities (verified via blockchain)
- 30% → Infrastructure and operations
- 10% → Founder

This is transparency and ethics-first technology. The platform provides AI tools for productivity while ensuring the majority of revenue directly benefits children's health and education causes.

If this aligns with your values or if you're aware of corporate matching opportunities at [Company Name], I'd welcome a conversation.

Worth a look: [Link]

Also - anyone know our corporate matching policy? 🤔
```

### Template D: CSR/Giving Channel (If Your Company Has One)

```
Hi CSR team!

I recently discovered FOR THE KIDS - an AI collaboration platform with an exceptional charitable commitment:

Key differentiators:

✅ Transparent, auditable giving (Gospel V1.3 compliance)
✅ Focus on verified pediatric health and education charities

This could be a strong fit for:
- Corporate partnership opportunities

## 3. INTERNAL EMAIL TO COLLEAGUES TEMPLATE

### Subject Line Options:
- "A cause I'm supporting - thought you might care too"
- "60% to kids' charities - AI platform doing it right"
- "Making my tech spending count for something"
- "Quick intro to a mission-driven platform I'm backing"

---

### Email Template (Personalized Version)

```
Subject: A cause I'm supporting - thought you might care too

Hi [Name/Team],

I wanted to share something with you because I know you care about [kids' causes/giving back/ethical tech].

I'm supporting a platform called FOR THE KIDS - it's an AI collaboration tool, but what makes it different is the business model:

**60% of all revenue goes to verified pediatric charities.**

Not "a portion of profits" or "up to X%." Literally 60 cents of every dollar, verified on the blockchain, going to help kids.

The founder, Joshua Coleman, actually reduced his own share from 20% to 10% to increase the charitable allocation from 50% to 60%. That kind of integrity is rare in tech.

Why I'm telling you:
1. If you use AI tools anyway, this one does good while being useful
2. If [Company Name] has matching gift programs, this could double the impact
3. If you know others who'd care, feel free to forward

No pressure - just wanted to share something I believe in.

Thanks for reading!
[Your Name]

P.S. If you know who handles corporate giving/matching gifts at [Company Name], I'd love an intro.

### 30-Minute Session: "FOR THE KIDS - Ethics-First AI"

**Target Audience:** Colleagues, team members, anyone curious
**Format:** Informal lunch session (virtual or in-person)
**Materials Needed:** Laptop/projector, pizza/snacks (optional), handout with links

---

### PRESENTATION OUTLINE

#### SLIDE 1: TITLE (1 min)
**"FOR THE KIDS: What Happens When an AI Platform Puts Kids First"**

- Your name
- "Why I'm passionate about this"
- "30 minutes, casual format, open Q&A"

---

#### SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM (3 min)
**"Tech Companies and Charity: The Usual Story"**

- Most companies: "We donate a portion of profits"
- Vague, unverifiable, marketing-speak
- No transparency, no accountability
- "Giving back" as PR, not priority

**Ask the room:** "How many companies can you name that tell you exactly what % of revenue goes to charity?"

---

#### SLIDE 3: THE FOR THE KIDS MODEL (5 min)
**"A Different Approach: Revenue-Based, Blockchain-Verified"**

**The Split:**
```
60% → Verified Pediatric Charities
30% → Infrastructure & Operations
10% → Founder
```

**Key Points:**
- Not "profits" - REVENUE (first dollar in = 60 cents to kids)
- Blockchain-verified (can't fake it, can't hide it)
- Verified charities only (no scams, no admin bloat)
- Gospel V1.3 = the immutable law of the platform

**Why this matters:** Founder literally gave up income to put kids first (reduced from 20% to 10%)

---

#### SLIDE 4: THE FOUNDER'S STORY (3 min)
**"Who Builds Something Like This?"**

- Joshua Coleman: Security researcher, coder, dad
- Built this after seeing too much tech greed
- Quote: "I took less so kids get more. Simple as that."
- Not a billionaire, not a VC-backed unicorn - just someone doing right

**Human moment:** Share why YOU connected with this mission

- Full transparency dashboard (coming soon)

**Demo (if available):** Quick 2-min platform walkthrough OR screenshot tour

---

#### SLIDE 6: THE IMPACT (4 min)
**"Where the Money Goes"**

**Target Charities (Examples):**
- St. Jude Children's Research Hospital
- Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)
- Make-A-Wish Foundation
- Ronald McDonald House Charities
- Verified pediatric education initiatives

**The Math:**
- 100 users at $X/month = $Y to charity annually
- Our company alone could generate $[calculate] for kids

**Blockchain verification:** Every dollar tracked, every charity audited

---

#### SLIDE 7: HOW YOU CAN HELP (5 min)
**"Ways to Get Involved (Choose Your Level)"**

**Individual Actions:**
1. Try the platform (if you use AI tools anyway)
2. Share on social media
3. Check corporate matching gifts (could double impact)

**Common questions to prep:**
- "How do I know the money actually goes to charity?" → Blockchain verification

## 5. CORPORATE MATCHING GIFT GUIDE

### "Double Your Impact: Corporate Matching Gifts 101"

**What is a Corporate Matching Gift Program?**

Many companies match employee charitable contributions dollar-for-dollar (or even 2:1 or 3:1). This means your $50 contribution becomes $100 (or more) for kids - automatically.

---

### STEP-BY-STEP: HOW TO GET YOUR COMPANY TO MATCH

#### STEP 1: Check if Your Company Has a Matching Program

**How to find out:**
1. Check your HR portal or intranet (search "matching gifts" or "charitable giving")
2. Ask your HR or CSR/ESG team directly
3. Use databases:
   - **Double the Donation**: https://doublethedonation.com/matching-gift-search
   - **HEP Development**: https://hepdevelopment.com/matching-gift-companies/

**Common companies with matching programs:**
- Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon
- Most Fortune 500 companies
- Many mid-size tech/finance/consulting firms

---

#### STEP 2: Understand Your Company's Policy

**Questions to ask HR/CSR:**
- Does our company match contributions to tech platforms with charitable missions?
- Do you match subscription fees or only direct donations?
- What is the matching ratio? (1:1, 2:1, etc.)
- Is there an annual limit per employee?
- What documentation is required?

**If they say "We only match 501(c)(3) donations":**
- FOR THE KIDS allocates 60% to verified 501(c)(3) charities
- Ask if they'll match the charitable portion of subscription fees
- Propose treating it as a "cause marketing partnership"

---

#### STEP 3: Submit Your Matching Gift Request

**What you'll need:**
- Proof of contribution (receipt, invoice, payment confirmation)
- FOR THE KIDS charitable mission documentation (Gospel V1.3, charity verification)
- Matching gift request form (from your HR/CSR team)

**Template email to HR/CSR:**

```
Subject: Matching Gift Request - FOR THE KIDS (60% charitable allocation)

Hi [HR/CSR Contact],

I'm an employee at [Company Name] and recently contributed to FOR THE KIDS, a platform that allocates 60% of all revenue to verified pediatric charities.

I'd like to request a corporate matching gift for my contribution.

**Details:**
- Platform: FOR THE KIDS (https://forthekids.ai)
- Charitable Model: 60% of revenue → verified 501(c)(3) pediatric charities
- My Contribution: $[Amount]
- Date: [Date]
- Receipt: [Attached]

**Why this qualifies:**
FOR THE KIDS operates under "Gospel V1.3" - a binding commitment to allocate 60% of all revenue to verified pediatric charities including St. Jude, CHOP, Make-A-Wish, and others. The allocation is blockchain-verified and transparent.

While this is a subscription platform (not a direct donation), the majority of my payment goes directly to kids' charities. I believe this aligns with [Company Name]'s commitment to employee giving and social impact.

**Request:** Will [Company Name] match my contribution (or the 60% charitable portion)?

I'm happy to provide additional documentation or connect you with the FOR THE KIDS team for verification.

Thank you for considering this request.

Best,
[Your Name]
[Employee ID, if applicable]
```

---

#### STEP 4: Follow Up and Advocate

**If they approve:** 🎉
- Thank them!
- Ask if this can be a recurring match (for ongoing subscriptions)
- Share the success with other employees

**If they deny:**
- Ask for clarification on why
- Request a policy exception or review
- Escalate to CSR leadership if appropriate
- Propose a formal corporate partnership instead (see below)

---

### CORPORATE PARTNERSHIP ALTERNATIVE

**If matching gifts don't work, propose this:**

```
Subject: Corporate Partnership Opportunity - FOR THE KIDS

Hi [CSR/ESG Leadership],

I'm reaching out to propose a corporate partnership between [Company Name] and FOR THE KIDS - a mission-driven AI platform.

**The Opportunity:**
FOR THE KIDS allocates 60% of all revenue to verified pediatric charities. Rather than individual employee matching gifts, [Company Name] could:

1. **Become a corporate subscriber** (team/enterprise plan) - 60% goes to kids automatically
2. **Sponsor employee access** - provide FOR THE KIDS platform to all employees as a benefit
3. **Co-marketing partnership** - align [Company Name] brand with children's charity impact
4. **ESG reporting benefit** - trackable, verifiable charitable impact for annual reports

This could be a win-win:
- Employees get productivity tools
- [Company Name] gets ESG/CSR credit
- Kids get 60% of every dollar

I'm happy to facilitate an introduction to the FOR THE KIDS team.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### MATCHING GIFT FAQS

**Q: Will my company match subscription fees?**
A: Some do, some don't. Position it as "charitable contribution via cause marketing platform" - emphasize the 60% allocation.

**Q: What if FOR THE KIDS isn't in their database?**
A: Provide Gospel V1.3 documentation and charity verification details. Many companies allow manual submissions for new organizations.

**Q: Can I match recurring subscriptions?**
A: Depends on company policy. Some match one-time, some match ongoing. Ask!

**Q: What if I get rejected?**
A: Escalate to CSR leadership, propose corporate partnership, or simply share with colleagues (collective impact still matters).

## 6. SOCIAL MEDIA POST TEMPLATES FOR EMPLOYEES

### LinkedIn Templates (Professional Network)

#### Template A: Personal Story (High Engagement)

```
I don't usually post about products, but this one is different.

I'm supporting FOR THE KIDS - an AI collaboration platform where 60% of every dollar goes to verified pediatric charities.

Not "a portion of profits." Not "up to X%." 60% of revenue. Verified on the blockchain. Going to kids who need it.

The founder, Joshua Coleman, literally took a 50% pay cut (from 20% to 10%) to move that money to charity. That's the kind of integrity I want to support.

If you:
- Use AI tools anyway (so why not use one that helps kids?)
- Care about children's health and education
- Want to see tech companies do better

Worth a look: [Link]

#ForTheKids #SocialImpact #EthicalTech #AIForGood

P.S. If your company does matching gifts, this could double your impact. Mine does - looking into it now.

#### Template B: Professional Endorsement

```
Excited to support FOR THE KIDS - a platform that's redefining what "mission-driven" means in tech.

The model: 60% of revenue → verified pediatric charities. Not profits. Revenue. First dollar in = 60 cents to kids.

This is transparency and accountability in action:
✅ Blockchain-verified charity allocation
✅ Gospel V1.3 binding commitment
✅ Verified 501(c)(3) charities only

The founder reduced his own share to increase charitable impact. That's the leadership we need in tech.

#### Template C: Call to Corporate Action

```
Question for my network in CSR/ESG roles:

What if your corporate AI tools sent 60% of revenue to verified children's charities?

I just found FOR THE KIDS - a platform doing exactly that. 60% to pediatric health/education charities, blockchain-verified, fully transparent.

Seems like a strong fit for:
- Corporate social responsibility goals
- Employee giving programs
- ESG reporting (trackable, verifiable impact)

Has anyone explored partnerships with mission-driven tech platforms like this?

Would love to hear thoughts.

#### Template B: Thread (Higher Engagement)

```
THREAD: I found an AI platform with the most ethical business model I've seen in tech.

Let me tell you why it matters. 🧵

1/ FOR THE KIDS (@ForTheKidsAI) is an AI collaboration platform. Standard tech product... except for the business model.

60% of REVENUE → verified pediatric charities.
30% → operations
10% → founder

Not profits. Revenue. First dollar in = 60 cents to kids.

2/ Here's what makes this rare:

Most companies: "We donate a portion of profits" (vague, unverifiable)

FOR THE KIDS: "60% of every dollar, blockchain-verified, to verified 501(c)(3) pediatric charities" (specific, transparent, auditable)

That's the difference between marketing and mission.

3/ The founder, Joshua Coleman, actually REDUCED his own share from 20% to 10% to increase the charitable allocation from 50% to 60%.

He took less so kids get more.

When's the last time you saw a tech founder do that?

4/ Why I'm sharing this:

- If you use AI tools anyway, use one that helps kids
- If your company has matching gifts, this doubles your impact
- If you want to see tech companies do better, support the ones that do

Learn more: [Link]

5/ Not asking anyone to buy anything they don't need.

Just saying: if you're already spending on AI tools, spend it somewhere that matters.
