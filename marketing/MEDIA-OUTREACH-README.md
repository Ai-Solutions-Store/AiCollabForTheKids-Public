## COMMON OBJECTIONS & QUICK RESPONSES

**Location:** PR-MEDIA-PITCHES.md (Section 13) or JOURNALIST-RELATIONSHIP-PLAN.md (Section 13)

**"This is just a tax write-off scheme"**
? We're a for-profit LLC. Allocations are deductible business expenses, but the 60% is hardcoded into smart contract. If purely for taxes, I wouldn't lock myself into 60% forever.

**"Blockchain is just crypto hype"**
? We're not selling tokens or NFTs. We're using smart contracts for what they're good at: Immutable, transparent record-keeping. That's utility, not hype.

**"AI-written code sounds risky"**
? All production code is reviewed. Claude generates code according to Gospel principles, but we have testing, validation, and federated AI governance (Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity).

**"How do we know you're actually allocating 60%?"**
? Check the smart contract on BaseScan: Planned (Q1 2026). Every allocation is timestamped and publicly verifiable.

**"What if the platform fails?"**
? If zero revenue, zero profit to allocate. But infrastructure is designed for perpetual operation: recycled servers (no cloud costs), open-source stack (no lock-in), distributed architecture (no single failure point).
