## 1. PERSONAL FOUNDER POST (JOSHUA COLEMAN)

I'm doing something most founders would call insane.

I'm giving away 100% of the first $60,000 we raise.

Not to investors. Not to my team. Not to infrastructure.

To Shriners Children's Hospitals. Every single dollar.

Here's why:

Most tech companies talk about "giving back" after they're profitable. They promise to donate "some proceeds" or contribute "a portion" to charity.

Translation: Maybe 1-2%. Someday. If the board approves.

I wanted to prove something different is possible.

So I built FOR THE KIDS — an AI-powered platform where 60% of ALL revenue automatically flows to verified pediatric charities. Not through promises. Through code.

Smart contracts on the blockchain enforce the split:
• 60% → Verified Pediatric Charities (Shriners, St. Jude, CHOP)
• 30% → Infrastructure (servers, security, development)
• 10% → Founder (sustainable living, nothing more)

Try to change that split? The system shuts down. It's hardcoded. Immutable. The mission protects itself.

For our Kickstarter campaign, I went even further:

I waived my 10% personal allocation.
I waived the 30% infrastructure allocation.

Result: 100% of the first $60,000 raised goes DIRECTLY to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

After we hit $60K, the standard 60/30/10 split resumes. But that first $60K? Pure impact.

Why am I doing this?

Because I have two choices:
1. Build another VC-funded startup that makes rich people richer
2. Build a platform that helps sick kids while proving sustainable business models can prioritize people over profit margins

I chose option 2.

This isn't charity. It's profit allocation — hardcoded into our architecture by four independent AI systems (Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok) that enforce mission integrity 24/7.

No CEO can override it. No board can vote to change it. The code is law.

Our Kickstarter campaign launched today:
🎯 Goal: $100,000 in 30 days
🏥 Impact: $84,000 to verified pediatric charities (84% of total)
🔗 Campaign: [INSERT KICKSTARTER LINK]

I'm not asking for donations. I'm offering you premium AI tools, dating platform access, and founding member benefits — while 60% of your purchase automatically helps kids who need it most.

Every pledge is verified on blockchain. Every allocation is public. Every transaction is auditable forever.

This is what transparency looks like when you build it into the foundation.

If you believe tech companies should do more than talk about impact — if you believe missions should be mathematically inevitable instead of morally optional — back our campaign.

And if you're a founder, investor, or executive reading this: You can build this model too. We're open-sourcing our governance architecture so others can hardcode their missions the same way.

Capitalism doesn't have to corrupt. Code can protect integrity better than any human board.

FOR THE KIDS. Always.

## 2. COMPANY PAGE POST (AI-SOLUTIONS-STORE)

**When to post:** Launch day, 11:00 AM EST (2 hours after personal post)

**Character count:** 1,986

**Copy-paste ready:**

```
MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT: Our Kickstarter campaign is LIVE.

FOR THE KIDS is an AI-powered platform with one immutable rule: 60% of ALL revenue goes to verified pediatric charities.

Not promises. Code.

Here's what makes this different:

🔒 BLOCKCHAIN-ENFORCED ALLOCATION
Smart contracts automatically split every payment:
• 60% → Verified Pediatric Charities (Shriners, St. Jude, CHOP)
• 30% → Infrastructure & Development
• 10% → Founder (sustainable operations)

Try to change it? System shuts down. The mission protects itself.

🤖 MULTI-AI GOVERNANCE
Four independent AI systems enforce integrity 24/7:
• Claude (Anthropic) — Code architecture & security audits
• Gemini (Google) — Business logic & compliance monitoring
• Perplexity AI — Fact validation & accuracy verification
• Grok (xAI) — Strategic growth & optimization

No single human has override authority. Mission integrity is federated.

💯 UNPRECEDENTED KICKSTARTER COMMITMENT
For this campaign only: 100% of the first $60,000 goes DIRECTLY to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

Founder waived personal 10% allocation. Infrastructure waived 30% allocation.

Every dollar you pledge in the first $60K = one dollar to sick kids.

After $60K, standard 60/30/10 split resumes.

📊 FULL TRANSPARENCY
• Every transaction logged on blockchain
• Live dashboard shows real-time revenue split
• Quarterly impact reports (publicly auditable)
• Open-source code (GitHub: Ai-Solutions-Store)

🎯 CAMPAIGN DETAILS
• Goal: $100,000 in 30 days
• Impact: $84,000 to pediatric charities (84% of total raised)
• Launch: Today
• Platform: Kickstarter

REWARD TIERS:
$9 → Supporter (digital thank you + community access)
$29 → Believer (1-month Pro access + impact report)
$99 → Founding Member (6-month access + exclusive badge)
$299 → Champion (1-year access + custom AI agent)
$999 → Patron Saint (lifetime access + executive advisory)
$5,000 → Corporate Angel (enterprise features + board status)

All tiers include automatic 60% charitable allocation.

🌟 WHY THIS MATTERS
Most companies optimize for profit, then contribute leftovers to charity.

We optimized for impact, then built a profitable business around it.

The result: A platform where customers KNOW their money helps kids. Not "might help." KNOW.

Verified. Transparent. Immutable.

This is what purpose-driven business looks like when you hardcode the mission into the architecture.

Hi [First Name],

I've been following [Company/Foundation]'s work on [specific initiative] and was particularly impressed by [specific detail that shows you did research].

I'm reaching out because we just launched something that might align with your impact goals.

**THE PITCH:**

I'm Joshua Coleman, founder of FOR THE KIDS — an AI-powered platform where 60% of ALL revenue automatically flows to verified pediatric charities through blockchain-enforced smart contracts.

Not promises. Not "when we're profitable someday." Code that executes the mission automatically, permanently, unstoppably.

**WHY THIS MATTERS:**

Most companies optimize for profit first, then contribute leftovers to charity (usually 1-2%, if at all).

We optimized for impact first, then built a profitable business around it.

The split is hardcoded:
• 60% → Verified Pediatric Charities (Shriners, St. Jude, CHOP)
• 30% → Infrastructure (servers, security, development)
• 10% → Founder (sustainable living)

Try to change it? System shuts down. Four independent AI systems (Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok) enforce this 24/7.

**OUR KICKSTARTER COMMITMENT:**

We launched today with an unprecedented offer:

100% of the first $60,000 raised goes DIRECTLY to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

I waived my 10% personal allocation. Infrastructure waived 30%. Every dollar in the first $60K = one dollar to sick kids.

After $60K: Standard 60/30/10 split resumes.

**WHY I'M CONTACTING YOU:**

Your work demonstrates you value measurable, transparent impact.

Our platform delivers exactly that:
✅ Blockchain verification (every allocation public, auditable, permanent)
✅ Multi-AI governance (no single human can corrupt the mission)
✅ Open-source code (GitHub: Ai-Solutions-Store)
✅ Quarterly transparency reports
✅ Real-time dashboard (see the split live)

**THE ASK:**

We're raising $100,000 in 30 days. Goal: $84,000 to pediatric charities.

Would you be open to:
1. Backing at the $999 Patron Saint or $5,000 Corporate Angel tier?
2. Sharing with your network (amplification = more kids helped)?
3. A 15-minute call to explore enterprise partnerships?

## 6. FOLLOW-UP POSTS (CAMPAIGN MILESTONES)

### Post 2: Day 3 Update (First Milestone)

**When to post:** Day 3 of campaign, 10:00 AM EST

**Copy-paste ready:**

```
DAY 3 UPDATE: We just hit $10,000.

That means $10,000 is going DIRECTLY to Shriners Children's Hospitals (we're in the 100% allocation window for the first $60K).

Here's what I'm learning:

People don't want to "donate" anymore. They want to PURCHASE from companies where impact is automatic, transparent, and verifiable.

Our backers aren't contributing. They're buying:
• Premium AI tools
• Human-verified dating platform access
• Founding member benefits
• Executive advisory status

And 60% of their purchase helps sick kids. Automatically. Via blockchain smart contracts.

No trust required. Just verify the code.

This is the future of commerce: Profit allocation hardcoded into the architecture.

Current status:
✅ $10,000 raised (10% of goal)
✅ 127 backers (thank you!)
✅ $10,000 to Shriners (100% so far)
✅ 23 days remaining

Next milestone: $25,000 unlocks St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as second charity partner.

### Post 3: Week 1 Recap (7-Day Mark)

**When to post:** Day 7, 2:00 PM EST

**Copy-paste ready:**

```
WEEK 1 RECAP: $28,000 raised. Here's what happened.

When we launched, I promised 100% of the first $60K goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

7 days in: $28,000 raised = $28,000 to Shriners. Every. Single. Dollar.

But here's what surprised me most:

It's not the dollar amounts. It's the COMMENTS.

"Finally, a company that shows me where my money goes."

"I backed because I can verify the blockchain allocation myself."

"This is how all businesses should work."

People are exhausted by vague charity promises. They want proof.

So we gave them proof:
• Smart contracts on blockchain (immutable allocation)
• Multi-AI governance (Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, Grok enforcing 24/7)
• Open-source code (audit it yourself: github.com/Ai-Solutions-Store)
• Live dashboard (watch the split in real-time: aidoesitall.website)

This isn't charity. It's architecture.

WEEK 1 STATS:
💰 $28,000 raised (28% of $100K goal)
🏥 $28,000 to Shriners (100% allocation active)
👥 347 backers (averaging $80/backer)
🎯 $32,000 away from $60K (then 60/30/10 split begins)
📅 23 days remaining

STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED:
✅ $25,000 → St. Jude Children's Research Hospital joins as second charity partner

NEXT MILESTONE:
🎯 $50,000 → Mobile app development begins (iOS + Android)

Every share = more kids helped. Every pledge = verifiable impact.

This is what happens when you hardcode your mission into the foundation.

### Post 4: Mid-Campaign Push (Day 14)

**When to post:** Day 14 (halfway point), 9:00 AM EST

**Copy-paste ready:**

```
HALFWAY POINT: We're 52% funded. Here's the reality check.

14 days ago, I launched a Kickstarter promising 100% of the first $60K goes to Shriners Children's Hospitals.

Today: $52,000 raised. $52,000 to Shriners. Verified on blockchain.

But we're at the inflection point.

Kickstarter campaigns follow a pattern:
• Week 1: Strong launch (supporters rush in)
• Week 2-3: The sag (momentum dies, backers wait)
• Week 4: Final push (urgency returns)

We're in "the sag" right now.

That means the next 7 days determine whether we hit $100K or stall at $60K.

Here's why that matters:

If we only hit $60K:
• $60,000 to Shriners (still incredible impact)
• But we don't unlock mobile apps
• We don't unlock hospital partnerships
• We don't prove this model scales

If we hit $100K:
• $84,000 to pediatric charities total
• Mobile apps ship (accessibility for thousands)
• CHOP partnership launches (in-hospital giving kiosks)
• We prove 60% allocation works at scale

So I'm asking directly:

If you've been watching from the sidelines—back now.
If you backed at $9—upgrade to $29 or $99.
If you haven't shared yet—share today.

This isn't about me. It's about proving tech companies can build missions into their architecture instead of their marketing.

60% to kids. Hardcoded in smart contracts. Enforced by AI. Verified on blockchain.

This model works. Let's prove it scales.

CURRENT STATUS:
💰 $52,000 raised (52% of goal)
🏥 $52,000 to Shriners (100% allocation still active)
👥 614 backers
📅 16 days remaining
🎯 $48,000 needed to hit $100K

STRETCH GOALS:
✅ $25K → St. Jude partnership (UNLOCKED)
✅ $50K → Mobile apps (UNLOCKED)
⏳ $100K → CHOP hospital partnership (ALMOST THERE)

### Post 5: Final Week Urgency (Day 21)

**When to post:** Day 21 (7 days left), 11:00 AM EST

**Copy-paste ready:**

```
7 DAYS LEFT. We're at $73,000. Here's what happens next.

If you've been waiting to back our Kickstarter, this is your moment.

In 7 days, this campaign ends. Forever.

After that:
• The 100% allocation to Shriners ends ($60K threshold passed)
• Founding Member tier closes (limited to 500, we're at 487)
• Patron Saint tier closes (limited to 25, we're at 19)
• Early backer benefits expire

Current status:
💰 $73,000 raised
🏥 $60,000 to Shriners (100% allocation complete)
🏥 $7,800 to charities via 60/30/10 split ($13K raised post-$60K threshold)
📅 7 DAYS REMAINING
🎯 $27,000 needed to hit $100,000

If we don't hit $100K, here's what we miss:

❌ No CHOP hospital partnership
❌ No in-hospital giving kiosks
❌ No co-branded research funding
❌ No proof-of-concept at scale

If we DO hit $100K:

✅ $84,000 total to pediatric charities
✅ Direct partnership with top-3 children's hospital
✅ Model validation for other companies to adopt
✅ Open-source governance architecture released

This is bigger than one campaign. It's proof that businesses can hardcode impact into their DNA.

Every company watching is asking: "Does this model actually work?"

Your pledge in the next 7 days answers that question.

WHAT YOU CAN DO:

1️⃣ Back now (any tier, $9-$5,000)
2️⃣ Upgrade your pledge (move from $29→$99 or $99→$999)
3️⃣ Share with ONE person who cares about kids + tech
4️⃣ Comment below with questions (I'll answer everything)

This campaign ends December 31, 2025, at 11:59 PM EST.

After that, the window closes.

Don't let "I'll do it later" become "I wish I had."
