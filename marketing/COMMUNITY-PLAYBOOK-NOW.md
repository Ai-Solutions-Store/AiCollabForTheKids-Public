## REDDIT ENGAGEMENT RULES

### Subreddits We Monitor

**Primary:**
- r/ethereum
- r/cryptocurrency (careful - volatile community)
- r/nonprofit
- r/SocialGood
- r/Charity
- r/ethdev
- r/web3

**Secondary:**
- r/ArtificialIntelligence
- r/MachineLearning
- r/OpenSource
- r/startup
- r/Parenting

- r/Mommit

### Engagement Rules

#### Rule 1: Add Value First
**WRONG:**
```
"Check out FOR THE KIDS! We send 60% to charity!"
[Gets downvoted to oblivion]
```

**RIGHT:**
```
Thread: "What's a project that actually gives back?"

Comment: "I've been researching this too. Found a few interesting
ones:

- GiveDirectly (cash transfers)
- WaterCharity (clean water)
- FOR THE KIDS (AI products, 60% to pediatric charities)

All have public financials which is key. The FOR THE KIDS one
is interesting because they use smart contracts so the 60% split
is literally coded and immutable.

Anyone else know of projects with on-chain transparency?"
```

**Why it works:**
- Provides multiple options (not just promoting yourself)
- Explains WHY it's interesting (smart contracts)
- Invites discussion
- Authentic tone

#### Rule 2: Respond to Organic Mentions
**When someone mentions FOR THE KIDS:**
1. Upvote (obvious but important)
2. Wait 2-4 hours before responding (don't seem like you're camping)
3. Add additional information they didn't cover
4. Thank them for spreading the word

**Template:**
```
Hey! Part of the FOR THE KIDS team here. Thanks for mentioning us!

Just to add some details [poster] didn't cover:
- [Additional fact 1]
- [Additional fact 2]

Happy to answer any questions about how the smart contract
enforces the 60% split or our charity verification process.

Appreciate you spreading the word about projects that actually
put money where their mouth is 🎯
```

#### Rule 3: Never Argue, Always Educate
**Scenario: Someone claims we're a scam**

**WRONG Response:**
```
"We're not a scam! Do your research!"
[Defensive, unhelpful]
```

**RIGHT Response:**
```
"Fair skepticism! Here's how we prove we're legitimate:

1. Open-source code: [GitHub link]
2. On-chain distributions: [Polygonscan link showing actual txns]
3. Monthly transparency reports: [link]
4. Smart contract audit: [link if available]

The 60% charity split is literally in the smart contract code.
It's not a promise - it's immutable code.

What specific concerns do you have? Happy to address them.
Our mission is too important (helping kids) to hide anything."
```

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges their skepticism as valid
- Provides concrete proof
- Invites further questions
- Stays mission-focused

#### Rule 4: Disclose Affiliation
**Always identify yourself:**
- "Disclosure: I'm part of the FOR THE KIDS team"
- "Full disclosure: I work on FOR THE KIDS"
- "Disclaimer: I'm involved with this project"

**Reddit hates stealth marketing. Transparency builds trust.**

#### Rule 5: Follow Subreddit Rules
**Before posting in ANY subreddit:**
1. Read the sidebar rules
2. Check if self-promotion is allowed
3. Look at successful posts for tone/format
4. Message mods if unsure

**Common restrictions:**
- Minimum karma requirements
- No new accounts
- Self-promotion only in designated threads
- No referral links

### Reddit Post Templates

#### Value-First Post (r/nonprofit, r/Charity)
```
Title: "Using Smart Contracts to Enforce Nonprofit Transparency"

Body:
I've been thinking a lot about donor trust in nonprofits.
According to [source], X% of people don't donate because they
don't trust where the money goes.

We've been experimenting with using Ethereum smart contracts
to make charity distributions completely transparent and
immutable. Here's what we learned:

**What Worked:**
- Donors can verify on-chain exactly where their money went
- Smart contract enforces the split (in our case 60% to charity)
- Monthly transparency reports pull directly from blockchain

**Challenges:**
- Gas fees (we moved to Polygon)
- Explaining blockchain to non-technical donors
- Charity onboarding to receive crypto

**The Code:**
[Link to GitHub]

Curious if other nonprofits have tried this? What transparency
mechanisms have worked for you?

(Disclosure: I work on FOR THE KIDS, which uses this model)
```

#### Discussion Starter (r/ethereum, r/ethdev)
```
Title: "Use Case: DAO Governance for Charity Distribution"

Body:
Building a DAO that governs charity selection and fund
distribution. Looking for feedback on our approach:

**Setup:**
- Product revenue → Smart contract
- 60% automatically allocated to charity pool
- DAO votes on which verified charities receive funds
- Distributions are on-chain and public

**Current Challenges:**
1. Gas optimization for vote tallying
2. Preventing Sybil attacks on voting
3. Keeping UI simple for non-technical users

**Code:**
[GitHub link]

**Questions:**
- Anyone tackled similar problems?
- Better governance mechanisms than token-weighted voting?
- Tips for charity verification on-chain?

Open to all feedback. This is for kids' charities so getting
it right matters more than getting it done fast.
```

### Reddit Response Templates

#### When Someone Asks "What Do You Do?"
```
We build AI productivity tools (think AI assistants, automation,
that kind of thing) but with a twist: 60% of all revenue goes
directly to verified pediatric charities.

The split is enforced by a smart contract, so it's not a promise
we can break - it's literally coded. Every distribution is
on-chain and public.

The idea is: AI is going to generate massive wealth. Why not
redirect some of it to kids who need it?

We're pre-launch right now (Kickstarter in [date]), but you can
check out the code and smart contracts now: [link]
```

#### When Someone Asks "How Do You Make Money?"
```
Great question. Here's the breakdown:

60% → Verified pediatric charities (immutable smart contract)
30% → Infrastructure, development, hosting
10% → Founder

It's called Gospel V1.3. The founder literally took less (moved
from 20% to 10%) so more could go to kids.

Is it a traditional business model? No.
Will we grow slower than a typical startup? Probably.
Is it worth it? Absolutely.

We're also community-governed (DAO), so eventually the community
decides which charities get funded.
```

#### When Someone Asks "Why Should I Care?"
```
Honestly? You might not, and that's okay.

But if you've ever thought "AI is making certain people insanely
wealthy while most people see no benefit," this is one attempt
to redirect that.

Every AI tool we sell sends 60% to kids' hospitals, pediatric
cancer research, food programs, etc. It's not charity - it's
built into the business model.

You're buying an AI tool you'd use anyway. Now 60% helps a kid.

If that resonates, cool. If not, no worries. There are a million
ways to help kids - this is just ours.
```

## TWITTER REPLY TEMPLATES

### Positive Engagement Templates

#### Someone Praises the Mission
```
Thanks for the support! Our goal is simple: make sure AI wealth
actually helps kids. 60% of everything → verified pediatric
charities. On-chain, transparent, immutable.

Appreciate you being part of this 🎯 FOR THE KIDS
```

#### Someone Shares Our Content
```
🙏 Thanks for amplifying! Every share helps us reach more people
who want their AI tools to actually make a difference.

60% to kids. Always. FOR THE KIDS.
```

#### Someone Asks How They Can Help
```
Amazing! A few ways to help:

1. Join our Discord: [link]
2. Become an Ambassador: [link]
3. Share our Kickstarter (when live): [link]
4. Nominate pediatric charities: [link]

Every action helps kids. Let's go 🎯
```

#### Influencer Mentions Us
```
Wow, thank you @[influencer]! Your platform reaching our mission
means more kids helped.

60% of all revenue → verified pediatric charities. No asterisks,
no fine print.

Would love to chat more about how you see AI & social impact
intersecting. DMs open.
```

#### Technical Compliment
```
Thanks! We obsess over making AI tools that are both powerful
AND ethical. Check out the code: [GitHub link]

Open source because transparency matters when 60% goes to kids.
```

### Negative Engagement Templates

#### Skeptical About Charity Claims
```
Healthy skepticism is good! Here's proof:

✅ Smart contract (60% is coded, not promised): [link]
✅ On-chain distributions (verify yourself): [Polygonscan link]
✅ Monthly reports: [link]
✅ Open-source code: [GitHub link]

Ask tough questions. We encourage it. FOR THE KIDS.
```

#### Criticism of Business Model
```
Fair point! Our model isn't traditional:

60% → Kids
30% → Infrastructure
10% → Founder

Will we grow slower? Probably.
Will we compromise? Never.

Not every business needs to maximize profit. Some can maximize
impact instead.

Appreciate the feedback 🎯
```

#### "This Sounds Too Good to Be True"
```
It did to us too at first! That's why we:

1. Put it in a smart contract (can't change the 60%)
2. Made everything open-source
3. Publish on-chain proof monthly
4. Let the DAO govern charity selection

We're not asking you to trust us. We're giving you tools to
verify us.

Docs: [link]
```

#### Troll / Bad Faith Attack
```
We're here to help kids, not argue on Twitter.

If you have genuine questions about our mission or financials,
we're happy to answer: community@forthekids.org

Otherwise, we're going to focus our energy where it matters 🎯
```

**Note:** For persistent trolls, mute/block rather than engage.
Don't feed negativity.

#### Competitor Comparison
```
There's room for lots of approaches to AI ethics!

What makes us different: 60% to charity is immutable (smart
contract), on-chain transparency, community governance.

But honestly? If another project gets more $ to kids, we'll
celebrate that too. Rising tide lifts all boats.

FOR THE KIDS 🎯
```

### Question Response Templates

#### "How Does the 60% Work?"
```
Great question! Here's the flow:

1. You buy an AI tool ($)
2. Revenue hits smart contract
3. Contract auto-splits: 60% charity, 30% infrastructure, 10% founder
4. DAO votes on which verified charities get the 60%
5. Distribution happens on-chain (public record)

Thread with more details: [link]
```

#### "Which Charities?"
```
We partner with verified 501(c)(3) pediatric charities. Current
list:

[List top 3-5 charities with links]

- [Executive Name], FOR THE KIDS
```

### Crisis Communication Principles

#### 1. Acknowledge Fast
**Speed matters more than having all answers.**

WRONG:
```
[6 hours of silence while investigating]
[Finally posts complete analysis]
[Community is already in panic mode]
```

RIGHT:
```
[15 minutes after issue detected]
"We're aware of reports of [issue]. Investigating now.
Updates in 30 min."

[45 minutes later]
"Update: We've identified the cause as [X]. Working on
fix. ETA 2 hours."

[Every hour until resolved]
```

#### 2. Be Honest About What You Don't Know
**Don't speculate. Say "investigating" if you're investigating.**

WRONG:
```
"This is probably just a minor glitch."
[Turns out to be major issue]
[Credibility destroyed]
```

RIGHT:
```
"We're investigating the root cause. Will update when we have
confirmed information. What we know so far: [facts only]."
```

#### 3. Own Mistakes Completely
**No excuses. No blame-shifting.**

WRONG:
```
"Our hosting provider caused the outage."
[Sounds like you're deflecting]
```

RIGHT:
```
"We experienced an outage due to our hosting infrastructure.
While the root cause was [provider], we're responsible for
our uptime. We're implementing [redundancy] to prevent this
in the future."
```

#### 4. Explain Impact Clearly
**People need to know how it affects THEM.**

WRONG:
```
"Database replication lag in secondary cluster."
[Too technical for most users]
```

RIGHT:
```
"Some users may see delays loading their dashboard (30-60 sec
instead of instant). Your data is safe. We're working to restore
normal speed."
```

#### 5. Always End With Action
**Tell people what happens next.**

Every crisis update should end with:
- Timeline for next update
- Expected resolution time (even if "TBD")
- Where to get more info
- What users should do (or NOT do)

**Template:**
```
NEXT STEPS:
- Our team is [specific action]
- Next update: [time]
- Expected resolution: [time or "investigating"]
- What you should do: [action or "nothing - we've got this"]

Status page: [link]
Questions: crisis@forthekids.org
```

### Post-Crisis Actions

#### 1. Post-Mortem (Public)
**Within 48 hours of resolution, publish:**

## COMMUNITY GROWTH TACTICS

### Organic Growth Strategies

#### 1. Value-First Content
**Principle:** Give before asking.

**Tactics:**
- Publish AI guides (not product pitches)
- Share transparency reports (even when not perfect)
- Open-source useful tools
- Write case studies helping others

## AMBASSADOR RECRUITMENT PROCESS

### What is an Ambassador?

**Definition:**
Community members who actively promote FOR THE KIDS mission
in exchange for recognition, exclusive access, and rewards.

**NOT:**
- Paid influencers (this is volunteer-driven)
- Marketing employees (they're community members)
- Required to sell (they share because they believe)

**Responsibilities:**
- Share FOR THE KIDS content authentically
- Engage in community discussions
- Provide feedback on products
- Nominate charities for voting
- Help onboard new members

**Benefits:**
- Early access to features
- Exclusive Ambassador Discord channel
- Monthly 1:1 with team
- Recognition on website
- Exclusive merch
- Voting power in DAO (weighted)
- Direct line to product team

### Ideal Ambassador Profile

**We're looking for people who:**
- Genuinely care about helping kids
- Active in at least one community (Discord, Twitter, Reddit, etc.)
- Understand (or want to learn) AI/web3
- Communicate clearly and positively
- Have time for 2-4 hours/week
- Align with our values (transparency, ethics, mission-first)

**We're NOT looking for:**
- Follower count (quality > quantity)
- Professional marketers (authenticity > polish)
- Sales-focused personalities (share, don't pitch)

### Application Process

#### Step 1: Self-Nomination
**Application Form Fields:**

```
FOR THE KIDS AMBASSADOR APPLICATION

1. Basic Info
   - Name:
   - Email:
   - Location (city/country):
   - Timezone:

2. Your Community
   - Twitter handle (if applicable):
   - Discord username:
   - Reddit username (if applicable):
   - Other platforms you're active on:

3. Why FOR THE KIDS?
   Tell us why you want to be an ambassador. What about our
   mission resonates with you? (150-300 words)

4. Your Superpower
   What's one thing you're great at that could help our
   community? (Examples: Writing, design, community building,
   technical explanations, event organizing, etc.)

5. Time Commitment
   Realistically, how many hours per week can you dedicate?
   [ ] 2-4 hours
   [ ] 4-6 hours
   [ ] 6-10 hours
   [ ] 10+ hours

6. Ideas
   If you could change one thing about how we communicate our
   mission, what would it be?

7. Quick Check
   - [ ] I've read GOSPEL.md and agree with the 60/30/10 split
   - [ ] I'm here to help kids, not make money
   - [ ] I'll be respectful even when I disagree
   - [ ] I understand this is volunteer (not paid)

8. One More Thing
   Tell us something that would help us know you better.
   (Could be anything - a fun fact, a personal story, your
   favorite charity, etc.)
```

**Where to Apply:**
- Link from Discord (#become-ambassador channel)
- Link from website footer
- Mentioned in newsletter monthly
- Twitter/LinkedIn posts quarterly

#### Step 2: Review Process
**Timeline: 7 days**

**Review Criteria:**
1. Application quality (effort + authenticity)
2. Values alignment (mission-first attitude clear?)
3. Community presence (active somewhere? doesn't have to be huge)
4. Unique contribution (what do they bring?)

**Red Flags:**
- Generic/copy-paste answers
- Only focused on personal benefits
- No evidence of community engagement anywhere
- Values misalignment

**Decision:**
- ✅ Accept → Move to Step 3
- 📧 Follow-up questions → Clarify something
- ❌ Decline (with kind explanation + invitation to reapply)

**Decline Template:**
```

## FINAL WORDS

**Remember:**

This playbook is a living document. Update it as you learn.

**The Mission Comes First:**
Every policy, every template, every decision should serve the
mission: 60% of all revenue to verified pediatric charities.

**Be Human:**
Templates are guidelines, not scripts. Adapt to each situation.
People can tell when you're being genuine.

**Transparency Always:**
When in doubt, be more transparent. Our community is built on
trust, and trust requires honesty.

**Celebrate Everything:**
Every new member. Every charity nomination. Every piece of
feedback. Every dollar to kids. Celebrate it all.

**You're Building Something Special:**
This isn't just a product community. It's a movement of people
who believe AI wealth should help kids. Treat it accordingly.

**FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS. 🎯**
