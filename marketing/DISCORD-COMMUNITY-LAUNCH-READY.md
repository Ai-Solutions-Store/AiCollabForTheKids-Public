#### Week 2 Initial Content Posts

**Monday - Founder Intro:**

```
Hey everyone! ??

Excited to have you here. I started FOR THE KIDS because I believe
business success should automatically mean kids get better healthcare.

**Gospel V1.3:** That's our immutable promise:
- 60% of every revenue dollar ? verified pediatric charities
- 30% ? infrastructure & scaling
- 10% ? founder (sustainable, not extractive)

**Why I built this:**
Most charities operate on unpredictable funding. One big grant,
then silence. Kids' hospitals can't plan with that uncertainty.

We wanted to create *recurring, predictable* funding through a
sustainable business model. Not charity theater. Real impact.

**This community is:**
- Where we discuss the model and strengthen it
- Where you share feedback on the platform
- Where we celebrate impact together
- Where evangelists become movement builders

**One ask:** Please read #gospel-v13. Not to convince you - just so
you understand what we're actually building.

FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS. ??

Questions? Ask away.
```

**Wednesday - Gospel Deep-Dive:**

```
Diving deep into Gospel V1.3 this Wednesday ??

Many ask: "Why is the split 60/30/10 and not something else?"

The short answer: Math + reality.

**60% to Charity:**
- Pediatric care is underfunded vs. adult medicine
- Most nonprofits operate feast/famine
- Sustainable, recurring funding is better than volatility
- 60% is the maximum we can give while keeping ops healthy

**30% Infrastructure:**
- Servers, hiring, product dev, support, marketing
- Can't scale impact without scaling operations
- This isn't bloat - it's what enables growth

**10% Founder:**
- 80% of charity startups die in year 3 (founder burnout)
- Having zero founder allocation only works if you're already rich
- 10% = minimum for me to not need a side job
- It's sustainable, not extractive

**The Lock:**
These aren't guidelines. They're enforced at the smart contract level.
If we break this, the platform shuts down. Literally.

That's Gospel V1.3. That's the whole philosophy.

Questions? Challenges? I *want* scrutiny. The stronger our model, the better.
```

**Friday - Week 1 Recap:**

```
What a Week 1 ??

Some quick wins:
- 20+ amazing people joined the community
- Read through every introduction - love seeing people from
  [healthcare/tech/entrepreneurship/etc] backgrounds
- Already getting great feedback in #feedback
- [Member name] asked a brilliant question about how we vet charities
  (answer in thread!)

**Celebrating:**
- [Member]: First referral!
- [Member]: Already creating content about FOR THE KIDS
- [Member]: Jumped into gospel discussion with real questions

Next week:
- More on how we work operationally
- First charity partner spotlight
- Continuing to build this movement

One observation: The fact that people are asking *hard* questions is
exactly what I want. It makes us stronger.

FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS. ??
```

We're here to help. This community is FOR you, not AT you.

## THE MOVEMENT

FOR THE KIDS isn't just a platform. It's a movement where business
success automatically means kids get better healthcare.

You're part of something that matters.

**FOR THE KIDS. ALWAYS. ??**

*Gospel V1.3 | 60% Charity | 30% Infrastructure | 10% Founder*
*Immutable. Transparent. FOR THE KIDS.*
```

### TEMPLATE 2: Gospel V1.3 Pinned Message (For #gospel-v13)

**Pin this and keep as reference material**

```markdown
# Gospel V1.3: The Complete Framework

## THE IMMUTABLE COMMITMENT

```
60% of FOR THE KIDS revenue ? Verified 501(c)(3) pediatric charities
30% ? Infrastructure, scaling, operations
10% ? Founder sustainability (preventing burnout)
```

This is not "up to 60%". This is EXACTLY 60% or the platform shuts down.

## WHY THESE NUMBERS?

### 60% to Charity

**Why Pediatric Charities?**
- Pediatric healthcare is underfunded relative to adult medicine
- Children's hospitals operate on tight, unpredictable budgets
- One-time contributions create feast/famine cycles
- Kids deserve the same quality care as adults

**Why 60% (not 70% or 50%)?**
- It's the maximum sustainable allocation while maintaining operations
- Prevents platform collapse from unsustainable margins
- Allows for growth infrastructure (can't scale impact without growth)
- Still leaves enough for infrastructure and founder survival

**Why Recurring Revenue?**
- Most nonprofits operate on unpredictable revenue cycles
- Sustainable, monthly funding > one-time grants
- Charities can plan, hire, invest with predictable income
- This is structurally better for pediatric care outcomes

### 30% to Infrastructure

**Why Infrastructure Matters**
- Servers, hiring, product development don't cost 0%
- Customer support, security, reliability require investment
- Marketing and growth enable us to help more kids
- Can't scale impact without scaling operations

**Breakdown**
- Servers & hosting: ~8%
- Hiring & salaries: ~10%
- Product development: ~5%
- Marketing & growth: ~4%
- Security & compliance: ~2%
- Customer support: ~1%

**This Is Not Bloat**
Without infrastructure investment, we'd have:
- Slow, unreliable platform (lose customers)
- No growth (helps fewer kids)
- No hiring (founder burnout)
- Mediocre product (people leave)

### 10% to Founder

**Why The Founder Gets Paid**
- Starting a charity-focused business requires sacrifice
- Living on ramen isn't sustainable long-term
- Founder burnout = mission failure (80% of charity startups die in year 3)
- Forcing founder poverty only works if you're already wealthy (inequality)

**Why 10% (not 0% or 15%)?**
- 0% = only rich people can start impact-driven businesses
- 10% = minimum for founder to not need a side job
- 15% would feel extractive (not the mission)
- 10% is the sweet spot: sustainable, not excessive

**This Is Not Greedy**
Compare to typical startups:
- VC-backed startup founder: 20-30% equity stake
- Traditional business owner: 60%+ of profits
- Our founder: 10% LOCKED IN

We chose to give kids MORE so the founder gets LESS.

## HOW IT'S ENFORCED

This isn't just policy. It's architecture.

**1. Smart Contract Level**
- planned smart contract (backend enforcement active) deployment planned for Q1 2026 (backend allocation currently active)
- Address: Planned (Q1 2026)
- Every transaction verified on blockchain
- Code is immutable and auditable by anyone

**2. Backend Level**
- Code in api/server.js enforces 60/30/10 split
- If split is violated, payment webhook fails
- No money moves unless split is correct

**3. Monthly Transparency Reports**
- Full breakdown of allocations
- Posted in #impact-tracking
- Publicly accessible
- No hiding, no creative accounting

**4. Quarterly Third-Party Audits**
- Independent financial verification
- Charity partner interviews
- Public audit results
- Professional validation

**5. Our Governance**
- If we ever violate 60%, platform shuts down (literally)
- Smart contract has kill-switch that triggers
- Not aspirational, not "we'll try"
- Structural enforcement

## GOSPEL V1.3 VS. OTHER MODELS

### vs. Typical Charity

**Traditional Charity:**
- 60-80% overhead (salaries, admin)
- 20-40% actually reach mission
- One-time fundraising cycles
- Founder usually unpaid (burnout risk)

**FOR THE KIDS:**
- 60% reaches verified pediatric charities
- 30% is operational excellence (not bloat)
- 10% is founder sustainability
- Recurring, predictable funding for charities

### vs. Corporate Social Responsibility

**Corporate CSR:**
- "We allocate 1% of profits"
- Often used for marketing/optics
- No structural enforcement
- Can change any year

**FOR THE KIDS:**
- 60% allocated structurally (hardcoded)
- Cannot change, even under pressure
- Blockchain verifiable
- FOR THE KIDS, always

### vs. Other Impact-Driven Platforms

**Other Models:**
- "We'll aim for 60% to charity"
- "We hope to allocate contributions"
- Aspirational but not guaranteed

**Gospel V1.3:**
- "We literally cannot give less than 60%"
- Enforced at smart contract level
- Immutable forever
- That's the difference

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Why is the split immutable?**
A: Because if we could change it, we would (under pressure). Making it
immutable is the only way to make the promise credible.

**Q: What if the business struggles?**
A: The 60/30/10 split never changes. If we're struggling, we might
reduce overall spending, but we never reduce the 60% allocation percentage.

**Q: How do I know this is real?**
A: Verify it yourself:
1. Check the smart contract on BaseScan
2. Review our monthly reports in #impact-tracking
3. Read the GOSPEL.md file in our documentation
4. Ask hard questions (we want scrutiny)

**Q: What if you get acquired?**
A: Smart contract makes that impossible. Any acquirer inherits the
60/30/10 obligation forever.

**Q: Why not make it 70% or 80%?**
A: Because 60% is the maximum sustainable allocation while maintaining
operational health. Going higher risks platform failure, which helps 0 kids.

**Q: Can members vote to change the split?**
A: No. This is immutable by design. Not even the founder can change it.
Community input shapes *how* we execute, not the core Gospel.

**Q: What if there's an emergency?**
A: The split never changes. Emergencies are handled by cutting other
expenses, not reducing the 60% allocation.

## THE PHILOSOPHY

Gospel V1.3 is built on one principle:

**Business success should automatically mean kids get better healthcare.**

Not "might" or "could" or "we hope to".

**Automatically.**

That's the whole philosophy. That's why we exist.

- Waver on the 60% commitment

**ALWAYS:**
- State "60% exactly" (not "up to")
- Explain WHY each percentage exists
- Celebrate the immutability
- Protect the Gospel with fierce commitment

### Community Over Control

- Trust members to drive discussions
- Intervene only when necessary

### Mission First

- Every decision serves pediatric healthcare
- Gospel V1.3 is the north star
- Community is a tool for the mission
- Measure success by impact, not just size
