## Writing Guidelines

### Voice & Tone

### Structure
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences): Relatable problem
2. **Context** (1 paragraph): Why this matters
3. **Technical Deep Dive** (3-5 sections): The meat
4. **Results** (1 section): Real data
5. **Lessons** (1 section): What you learned
6. **CTA** (1 paragraph): Soft product mention

### Code Samples
- Use real, working code (not examples)
- Include comments explaining logic
- Show error handling
- Provide context before and after code block

### Product Mentions
- **Natural placement:** "The full system (Income Droid) is available at..."
- **Value-first:** Explain what it does before linking
- **No hard sells:** Link, don't pitch
