Hi,

I'm reaching out because I've built something that might interest you: a DAO with an IMMUTABLE 60/30/10 revenue split hardcoded into the smart contract.

**The Problem We Solved:**
Traditional charities spend 15-30% on overhead and have trust issues. Donors never know if their money actually reached the cause.

**Our Solution:**
- 60% of ALL revenue automatically flows to verified pediatric charities
- 30% to infrastructure
- 10% to founder
- This split is IMMUTABLE - not even I can change it

**Proof It Works (First Transaction Live):**

Every donation triggers an on-chain split. No human can intercept funds. No administrative overhead. Just math.

**Why I'm Reaching Out:**
I believe organizations like yours could benefit from featuring projects that demonstrate blockchain's true potential for charity. Our model proves that "trust" can be replaced with "verify."

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss how this might align with your mission?
