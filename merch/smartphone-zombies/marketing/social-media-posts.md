Sometimes the best social commentary comes in the form of a yellow warning sign.

"Beware of Smartphone Zombies" started as a funny observation about our digital addiction - but it became something more.

We're turning this into a force for good:

60% of all profits from this merch line go directly to verified children's medical care through Kids DAO.

In a world where we're all guilty of being glued to our screens, this is a chance to use that same technology to help kids who need it most.

Available: T-Shirts, Hoodies, Stickers, and iPhone Cases

Sometimes doing good is as simple as buying a shirt that makes people smile.

Hey there,

Let's be honest - we've all been smartphone zombies at some point.

Walking into things. Missing conversations. Doom scrolling at 2am.

We made a shirt for that. And hoodies. And stickers. And phone cases (the irony isn't lost on us).

But here's what makes this different:

60% OF ALL PROFITS GO TO CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CARE

Through Kids DAO (Verified Medical Pediatrics), every purchase directly funds healthcare for children who need it.

Shop now:
