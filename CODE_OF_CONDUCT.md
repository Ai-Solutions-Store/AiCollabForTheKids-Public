# Code of Conduct

## FOR THE KIDS Preamble

**This project exists to fund pediatric healthcare. Zero tolerance for drama, politics, or ego. We are here for the kids.**

Every contributor, maintainer, and community member is bound by this simple truth: the mission comes first. Personal agendas, flame wars, and toxic behavior have no place here because they distract from helping children.

## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards

**Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:**

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community and mission

**Examples of unacceptable behavior:**

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Any attempt to circumvent, modify, or undermine the 60/30/10 Gospel split

### Mission-Specific Standards

Because this project directly funds children's medical care:

* **No Drama:** Disagreements about code are fine. Personal attacks are not.
* **No Politics:** We don't care about your political views. We care about helping kids.
* **No Ego:** Your clever solution isn't worth it if it makes the code unmaintainable.
* **No Greed:** Attempting to redirect charitable funds is grounds for immediate ban.

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

* GitHub Issues (for public matters)
* Direct message to maintainers (for sensitive matters)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Enforcement Guidelines

**Consequence:** A private, written warning, providing clarity around the nature of the violation.

#### 2. Warning
